<p>Ben Hammersley was <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/weblog/2005/03/07/frameworks.html">debating with himself</a> in public whether to dive into Ruby on Rails or stay with his trusty Perls and pick up on Maypole:</p>
<blockquote>Should I learn Perl with Maypole, or Ruby on Rails? Perl I know, Ruby I don&rsquo;t; Maypole seems a bit under the radar, Rails is hot hot hot; Perl has shedloads of modules to give other really useful features, Ruby has less.</blockquote>
<p>I offered my always impartial and objective advice that perhaps Ruby on Rails would open his mind more. Learning a new language and all. Hammersley responded:</p>
<blockquote>I&rsquo;m inclined to go with his sage advice and learn a new language as well. And a new version came out this morning, too. That&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m sold.</blockquote>
<p>Welcome on board, Ben!</p>
