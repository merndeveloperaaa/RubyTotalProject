<p><a href="http://43things.com">43things.com</a> has just been in the air for a week and already do they have <i>3,000 people are doing 10,804 things</i>! That&#8217;s an incredible achievement in such a short period of time and bodes well for the future success of the application. 43things.com will undoubtedly soon become a reference point for discussing performance with Rails.</p>
<p>Speaking of performance, Bob Cottrell is their main man on <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">MemCached</a> integration and also the contributor of <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/file/trunk/actionpack/lib/action_controller/session/mem_cache_store.rb">MemCacheStore</a> in Rails 0.9.3. He has promised to start writing about how best to use MemCached with Rails and were eagerly awaiting his guides.</p>
