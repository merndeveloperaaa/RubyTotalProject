<p>Veteran web developer site Webmonkey has jumped on board with <a href="http://webmonkey.wired.com/webmonkey/05/28/index4a.html">Getting Your Feet Wet With Ruby on Rails</a>. A brief introduction to why you should care about Ruby on Rails and a brief look at tweaking an initial scaffolding setup. Their description of Rails is rather neat:</p>
<blockquote>Rails is a programming toolbox, with a wealth of pre-written code that implements the structure and many of the common functions of a database-driven site. That eliminates much of the preliminary busywork necessary to create such a site, but also enforces a tight, sane structure on the code, which has the effect of making development very facile. It&#8217;s like working in a well-organized company: it takes a little time to figure out who sits where and what they do, but once you understand the structure, you can use it to your advantage without having to make lots of micro-managerial decisions all the time.</blockquote>
