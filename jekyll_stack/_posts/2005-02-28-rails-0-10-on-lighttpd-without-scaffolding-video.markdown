<p>Matt Moriarity has managed to do something I&#8217;ve been pledging for a long time: Record an updated video for Rails 0.10 using lighttpd and <i>not</i>&#8220;cheating&#8221; by using scaffolding. Very cool. He builds a small weblog all by hand and even stops to comment on the approach in text throughout.</p>
<p>Check it out Moriarity&#8217;s excellent video: <a href="http://media.everamber.com/updated_rails_tutorial.mov">Site 1</a>,  <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/media/video/updated_rails_tutorial.mov">Site 2</a></p>
<p><i>I mistakenly attributed this to Stian Gryt&oslash;yr in the original post. Sorry about that, Matt</i></p>
