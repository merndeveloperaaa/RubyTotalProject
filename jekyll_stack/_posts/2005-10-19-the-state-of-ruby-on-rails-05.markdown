<p>Thanks to Jim Freeze and Bill Kleb, we have excellent <a href="http://yhrhosting.com:7000/">audio recordings of all the RubyConf talks</a>. Together with the slides, you can at least get the sense of being there. And of course realize that RubyConf &#8217;06 (and RailsConf &#8217;06?) is something you can not miss.</p>
