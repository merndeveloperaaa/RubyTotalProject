<p>Ruby superstar <a href="http://www.onestepback.org/">Jim Weirich</a> gives an <a href="http://www.onestepback.org/index.cgi/News/IntroToRailsMovieAvailable.red">insightful overview</a> of the environment that led to Rails, showing how it strikes a balance between <span class="caps">PHP</span> and Java. We&#8217;ve seen this bisection played out culturally as well, with widespread Rails adoption by designers and enterprise Java programmers alike.</p>
<p>Jim prefaces his talk by saying it isn&#8217;t technical but more of an introduction to Rails. Don&#8217;t let that dissuade you from watching. He presents a very lucid and concise illustration of how Rails has positioned itself amongst the old garde, cherry picking the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.rubynuby.org/pages/downloads">video</a> is not to be missed. Jim&#8217;s rapid fire style of presentation is a site to behold. Great stuff.</p>
