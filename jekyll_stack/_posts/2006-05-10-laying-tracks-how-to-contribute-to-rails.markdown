<p><a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/">Josh Susser</a> is at it again. He&#8217;s whiped up a <span class="caps">PDF</span> presentation called <a href="http://hasmanythrough.com/layingtracks/LayingTracks.pdf">Laying Tracks</a> which details the hows and the whys of contributing patches to Rails.</p>
<p>At just 16 slides, it&#8217;s short but meaty. He sums up the patch making and contributing workflow succinctly. This should be required reading for anyone looking to submit code to Rails core.</p>
