<p>Jason Hunter explains in an article called <a href="http://www.servlets.com/blog/archives/000068.html">The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma: It&#8217;s Happening to Java</a> why there&#8217;s such a big interest in Ruby on Rails from the big Java thinkers like himself:</p>
<blockquote>Ruby on Rails today looks poised to eat Java&#8217;s mindshare on the web tier. If not Rails, then something else. Empirically 10 years seems like the right point. Java&#8217;s viewed as solid and stable, mature enough for the most stodgy business folks. That leaves a large soft underbelly for a technology intended to help small teams (10 or fewer) who just want to make a site that&#8217;s good enough without paying a high price in mental effort.</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve written earlier on <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000412.html">Rails as a disruptive technology</a> according to Christensen&#8217;s framework of thinking.</p>
