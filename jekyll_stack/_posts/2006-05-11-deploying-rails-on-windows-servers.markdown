<p>Most Rails applications are deployed in a Unix server environment. Tools like <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17">Capistrano</a> make this dead easy. For those working in a Windows environment, deployment can get considerably harder. The good news is that it&#8217;s still possible and just got a lot easier.</p>
<p>Brian Hogan has developed <a href="http://www.napcs.com/howto/rails/deploy/">a series of articles</a> with instructions for various methods of deploying Rails applications in a Windows server environment. Broken up across four articles, the topics covered are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.napcsweb.com/howto/rails/deployment/RailsWithApacheAndMongrel.pdf">Serving Multiple Rails Applications on Windows with Apache and Mongrel</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.napcsweb.com/howto/rails/deployment/railsonIISWithApacheFCGI.pdf">Integrate Rails into an Existing <span class="caps">IIS</span> Web infrastructure using Apache and FastCGI</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.napcsweb.com/howto/rails/deployment/railsonIISWithMongrel.pdf">Integrate Rails into an Existing <span class="caps">IIS</span> Web infrastructure using Mongrel</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.napcsweb.com/howto/rails/deployment/railsonIISWithLighttpdAndMongrel.pdf">Integrate Rails into an Existing <span class="caps">IIS</span> Web Infrastructure using Lighttpd and Mongrel</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers to Brian for sharing the fruits of his labor.</p>
