<p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6356">Ruby on Rails: Enjoying the Ride of Programming</a>, the tutorial I&#8217;m giving at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005"><span class="caps">OSCON</span></a>, is the third most popular tutorial for the entire conference! As Nathan Torkington from O&#8217;Reilly <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/06/oscon_top_tutor.html">writes</a>: &#8220;Tutorial signups for <span class="caps">OSCON</span> are a great measure of what&#8217;s hot in Open Source.&#8221; Rails most surely be hitting the hot still.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not only Rails. <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6706">Dave Thomas&#8217; Ruby tutorial</a> is #8 on the same list! It&#8217;s going to be a fantastic conference for Ruby on Rails. And I&#8217;m not only saying that because I&#8217;m doing a keynote, a session talk, and this tutorial on the subject. Not at all. Really.</p>
