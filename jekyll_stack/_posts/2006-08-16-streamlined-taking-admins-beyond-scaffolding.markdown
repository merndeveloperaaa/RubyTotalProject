<p>Justin Gehtland and Stuart Halloway has been moving along at a rapid pace on <a href="http://streamlined.relevancellc.com/">Streamlined</a> since its unveiling at RailsConf in June. There&#8217;s now a <a href="http://streamlined.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/08/11/anonymous-svn-available">public repository</a> with the code available and they&#8217;ve put together a <a href="http://streamlined.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/08/02/screencast-available">convincing screencast</a> of its use.</p>
<p>I really like their approach of using separate UI classes instead of contaminating the model classes with administrative concerns. It has a great feel and look to it. Exciting to see it move forward.</p>
