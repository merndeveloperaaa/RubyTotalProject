<p>We opened up <a href="http://railsconf.org/pages/registration">registration</a> for <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf 2006</a> just over 12 hours ago and already have <strong>over 100 people signed up</strong>! Dave Thomas and Mike Clark&#8217;s <a href="http://railsconf.org/pages/guidebook">Guidebook</a> session is also already half full so if you were planning on coming to RailsConf I would act sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>So go <a href="http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=104160">sign up now</a>.</p>
