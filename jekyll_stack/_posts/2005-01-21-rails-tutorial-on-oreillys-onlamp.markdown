<p><img src="http://redhanded.hobix.com/images/onlamp-rails.gif" align="right" /> Curt Hibbs has written a great tutorial called <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html?page=1">Rolling with Ruby on Rails</a>. It takes the reader through setting up Ruby on Rails, scaffolding an application into immediate use, and tailoring the results. It&#8217;s focus is especially on setting everything up and using it with a Windows machine. It has been published by O&#8217;Reilly with their ONLamp.com site. A small note from the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>What would you think if I told you that you could develop a web application at least ten times faster with Rails than you could with a typical Java framework? You can&mdash;without making any sacrifices in the quality of your application! How is this possible?</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m always hesitant to provide any exact measures of productivity increases, but the 10x number has been echoed by more than a few of the Java programmers I&#8217;ve known coming over. Of course, most projects involve lots more than just programming, so this would hardly mean a project <i>completed</i> 10x &mdash; or whatever multiplier you fancy &mdash; but the difference is indeed startling.</p>
<p>In any case, awesome work, Curt! Let this serve as an encouragement for other Railers to spread the good work by getting their knowledge published by outfits like O&#8217;Reilly.</p>
