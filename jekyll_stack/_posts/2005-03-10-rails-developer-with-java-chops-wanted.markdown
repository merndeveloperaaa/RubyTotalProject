<p>Jason Wong from <a href="http://www.ionami.com/">ionami</a> in San Francisco wants to hire a Rails developer with Java chops to help him through the transition from Java to Ruby on Rails:</p>
<blockquote>ionami is looking for one part time (20 hrs/week) with a migration to full time work, for a maintenance and development position. Here&rsquo;s the catch. You have to know Java really well, and know your way around Oracle. Additionally, <span class="caps">XML</span>, <span class="caps">XSLT</span>, and JS would be helpful. Our client is expanding, and the work is heavy Java, but I&rsquo;m also migrating the rest of our shop work to Ruby on Rails, where possible. We just acquired our first Fortune 500 Rails customer. So if you have Java chops, and want to do Rails work, send a resume to jobs at ionami dot com.</blockquote>
