<p><a href="http://www.FunnyOrDie.com/">Funny Or Die</a> is pulling high G&#8217;s scaling their Rails site to handle 9GBps of video and 20MBps of compressed <span class="caps">HTML</span> traffic from the stunts of Will Ferrell and others. Their <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/74">top video</a> has been seen no less than 50 million times. Rock on, guys.</p>
