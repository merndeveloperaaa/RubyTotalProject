<p>Lighthouse &#8220;version 2&#8221; deployed yesterday, so I&#8217;m officially opening the <a href="http://rails.lighthouseapp.com">Rails Lighthouse tracker</a> up for business.  Other spinoff projects such as <a href="http://prototype.lighthouseapp.com">Prototype</a> and <a href="http://capistrano.lighthouseapp.com">Capistrano</a> have already made the switch. As David has mentioned, this means the current <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org">trac instance</a> is deprecated.  It will continue to stay in use for now until everyone has transitioned to Lighthouse.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still figuring out the new workflow with git, Github, and Lighthouse.  I&#8217;ll be working with the <a href="http://logicalawesome.com">Logical Awesome</a> folks to improve the <a href="http://github.com/blog/41-service-integration">Lighthouse/Github relationship</a>.  I&#8217;m also working with Tim Pope (author of the awesome <a href="http://git.tpope.net/?p=git-trac.git;a=summary">git-trac tool</a>) and others in #rails-contrib on bringing the same development tools to the new git infrastructure.  Tim also wrote some <a href="http://www.tpope.net/rails-git-best-practices">best practices for contributing to Rails from git</a>.</p>
