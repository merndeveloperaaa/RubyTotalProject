<p>Avi Bryant is the creator of <a href="http://www.seaside.st/">Seaside</a>, the Smalltalk web-framework built on continuations, that has been shining light on alternatives to traditional <span class="caps">MVC</span>- and request/response-based frameworks. I heartily recommend taking a look. It might not fit your brain (it didn&#8217;t mine), but its sure to expand it.</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://paranode.com/~topfunky/audio/2005/Avi-Bryant.mp3">Avi has been interviewed by Geoffrey Grosenbach</a> for the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Podcast</a>. (Unfortunately, the audio is pretty grainy.. hang in there for the first few minutes).</p>
