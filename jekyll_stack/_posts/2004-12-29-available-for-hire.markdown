<p>I&#8217;m regularly getting requests from people who wants to start up Rails development, but are looking for a way to kick-start the affair by retaining one or more experts. Some make good candidates for referring to the firms listing themselves on the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/CommercialSupport">Commercial Support</a> page while others are looking to hire developers into their team on either a contract or full-time basis.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for the latter scenario that I&#8217;ve started the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/AvailableForHire">Available for Hire</a> page on the wiki. If you&#8217;re a single developer looking for work with Ruby, please do add yourself to that page if you feel your skill set is at a level where you could consider yourself &#8220;capable&#8221; with Rails.</p>
<p>Defining &#8220;capable&#8221; is always hard, but you should probably at least have made significant contributions to the framework and/or have one or more Rails projects under your belt. Such a project can very well be a demo application, though. It needs not be commercial work.</p>
