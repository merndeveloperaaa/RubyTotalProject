<p>Yahoo! Research Labs has a pretty cool new app out making markets out of buzz called <a href="http://buzz.research.yahoo.com/bk/index.html">Buzz Game</a>. It uses the Yahoo search engine to identify hot topics and assigns a dollar value based on that. When you sign up, you get $10,000 to trade for an can invest as you see please.</p>
<p>Now the reason this is terribly interesting is of course that they have a <a href="http://buzz.research.yahoo.com/bk/market/market.html?_mid=11024">Web Application Frameworks market</a>. And as I spotted this, I saw that <a href="http://buzz.research.yahoo.com/bk/market/market.html?_mid=11024&_ono=9">Rails was already trading</a> at <i>twice</i> the value of number two (Flex) and more than four times the value of Java. Wow!</p>
<p>Puzzled as to what all this would mean, I asked recognized internet entrepreneur <a href="http://www.commonme.org/">Thomas Madsen-Mygdal</a>. As the founder of internet conference <a href="http://www.reboot.dk/">Reboot</a>, co-founder of wifi hotshot <a href="http://www.organicnetwork.net/">Organic</a>, and a slew of other companies, I knew he would know. While Rails was trading at $22, he predicted:</p>
<blockquote><i>I see the core fundamentals in the Rails market taking it to 80 dollars six months. A strong buy recommendation.</i></blockquote>
<p>Holy moly! That&#8217;s a four-fold increase prediction right there. Not one to distrust Thomas, I immediately invested all my starting capital of $10,000. Are you in yet?</p>
