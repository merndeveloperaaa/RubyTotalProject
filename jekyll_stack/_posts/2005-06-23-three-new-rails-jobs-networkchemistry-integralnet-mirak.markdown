<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.networkchemistry.com/company/rubyposition.php">NetworkChemistry</a>: Looking for a Rails programmer with a C/C++ background and at least one successfully delivered Rails application for their Wireless Intrusion Prevention product in San Francisco.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.integralnet.com/jobs/ruby_programmer.html">IntegralNet Marketing</a>: Looking for an experienced Ruby/Rails developer with J2EE knowledge for eXtreme Programming work in Orange County, CA.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/peter.emond/mirakjobopportunity.html">Mirak</a>: Looking for a Rails developer with several projects completed and patches made against the source to work on an online community knowledge system in Toronto, Canada (working remote equally fine).</li>
</ul>
