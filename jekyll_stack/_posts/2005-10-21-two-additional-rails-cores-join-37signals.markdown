<p>Sam Stephenson and Marcel Molina are no longer available for custom consulting jobs through Ionist. Both are now <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/here_we_grow_welcome_two_new_signals.php">&#8220;made men&#8221; of the 37signals syndicate</a>. They will certainly continue to amuse us all through <a href="http://project.ioni.st/">projectionist</a>, though.</p>
<p>That restores the 37signals part of the Rails core to 1/3. Still down from 1/1 in January and 1/2 before going to a counsel of 12. But once again respectable ;)</p>
