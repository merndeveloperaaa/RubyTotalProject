<p>Daryl <a href="http://www.wakatara.com/blog/index.php/archives/2005/01/24/why-you-need-to-check-out-ruby-on-rails/">discovers</a> Ruby on Rails:</p>
<blockquote>Ruby on Rails is unbelievably good. It&rsquo;s too good to be true almost&#8230; Quite honestly, in an afternoon I built a completely working web application without the fancy css frills and such mind you, but completely usable that would have taken me the weekend with other methods&#8230; I&rsquo;m still kind of in shock as to how productive I was this weekend with RoR. And this was <i>while</i> learning how to program in Ruby.</blockquote>
