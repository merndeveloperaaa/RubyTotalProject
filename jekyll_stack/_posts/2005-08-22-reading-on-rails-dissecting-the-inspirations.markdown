<p>Tim Case has started a series of entries on his blog called <a href="http://karmacrash.com/articles/2005/08/04/announcing-readingonrails">Reading on Rails</a>. In this series, he examines how some of the major trends in software development, like <a href="http://karmacrash.com/articles/2005/08/04/readingonrails1-test-driven-development">test-driven development</a> and <a href="http://karmacrash.com/articles/2005/08/11/readingonrails-2-refactoring">refactoring</a>, relates to Rails. And what literature you should be picking up if you want to know more. Great stuff.</p>
