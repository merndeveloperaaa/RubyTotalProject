<p>The flow of new Rails books seems unstoppable these days and it&#8217;s hard to keep up with all of the new releases. But there are two books that I&#8217;ve recently have had a chance to taste that I&#8217;d like to highlight.</p>
<p>The first is The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321445619">Rails Way by Obie Fernandez</a>, which I wrote the foreword for. It&#8217;s a big whooper of a book (900+ pages!), but also a very comprehensive walk-through for the Rails developer who already has his feet wet. It also includes a good dose of community commentary on the how&#8217;s and why&#8217;s, which I rather like.</p>
<p>The second is <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_arr">Mike Clark&#8217;s Advanced Rails Recipes</a>, which is still not finished, but there&#8217;s a beta book available. It takes up from Chad Fowler&#8217;s original Rails Recipes book and gives you another 72 how-tos on more in-depth topics, such as <span class="caps">REST</span>, deployment, and testing. I&#8217;ve had a chance to taste a few of the recipes already and it&#8217;s good stuff.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a new Rails book that you really like, write a note in the comments and point people to it.</p>
