<p>Ruby 1.8.2 contains a year&#8217;s worth of bug fixes, so its release was a very welcome Christmas present from the honorable Matz. Among the many fixes and changes are the fact that Dave Thomas&#8217; <code>ri</code> documentation system is now included by default. Oh so very welcome. The new release is to find in source form at <a href="ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.2.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.2.tar.gz</a>.</p>
<p>Please note, that Rails currently have one known bug when running under 1.8.2 in form of <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/ticket/351">#354</a> &#8212; soon to be fixed.</p>
