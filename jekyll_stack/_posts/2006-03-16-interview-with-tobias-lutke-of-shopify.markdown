<p>The decidedly right-brained <a href="http://www.slash7.com/">Amy Hoy</a> sat down for an <a href="http://www.slash7.com/articles/2006/03/15/interview-with-tobi-lutke-of-shopify">interview</a> with with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/core">core member</a> and Rails old-timer <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com">Tobias LÃ¼tke</a>. They talk about <a href="http://jadedpixel.com/">Jaded Pixel&#8217;s</a> greatly anticipated <a href="http://shopify.com/">Shopify</a> as well as its theme builder, <a href="http://vision.shopify.com/">Vision</a>. Maybe Amy will start doing interviews like this more often&#8230;</p>
