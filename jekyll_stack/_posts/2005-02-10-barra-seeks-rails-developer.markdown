<p><a href="http://www.mscibarra.com/"><span class="caps">MSCI</span> Barra</a> is <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/eby/sof/59090149.html">looking for a developer</a> that preferably is already up-to-speed with Ruby on Rails or at least interested in getting it. It&#8217;s pretty darn cool to see a company like Barra list Ruby as a required skill and Rails as a preferred one.</p>
<p>The short bio on Barra:</p>
<blockquote>Join <span class="caps">BARRA</span>, the world&#8217;s leading provider of analytical investment and trading solutions. Our products are used by many of the most prestigious investment institutions in today&#8217;s exciting global financial markets to determine investment strategies.

<p>The job posting was made to craigslist&#8217;s San Francisco East Bay Area listing, so I expect its primarily targeting locales in that area.</p>
