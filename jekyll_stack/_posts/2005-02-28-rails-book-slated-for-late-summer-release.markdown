<p>Dave Thomas is busy writing the first Rails book and has been making great progress lately. In his blog post <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Tech/RailsWeek.rdoc">Quite a Week For Rails</a>, he says:</p>
<blockquote>I&rsquo;ve actually finished enough of my new Rails book that I&rsquo;ve released some chapters to a wonderful panel of reviewers (no more needed right now, thanks). I&rsquo;m starting to get happy about the way this book is turning out&mdash;I&rsquo;m looking forward to a late-summer release.</blockquote>
<p>The book is naturally to be published by <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/bookshelf/index.html">The Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> and distributed by O&#8217;Reilly.</p>
