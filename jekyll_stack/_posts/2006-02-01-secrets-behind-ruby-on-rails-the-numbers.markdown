<p>ITConversations has just made David&#8217;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/"><span class="caps">OSCON</span> 2005</a> keynote, <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail658.html"><em>Secrets Behind Ruby on Rails</em></a>, available for <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/audio/download/ITConversations-658.mp3">download</a>.</p>
<p>One of the big stories for Rails in August was the numbers behind its budding ecosystem. The conference fell right around Rails&#8217; first anniversary and the numbers one year in were promising. Today, six months down the road, they keep going up.</p>
<p>In the year between when Rails was released and the <span class="caps">OSCON</span> 2005 keynote, it was downloaded 100,000 times. In the six months since then it&#8217;s up to 300,000.</p>
<p>Estimates on the Rails wiki in August indicated that there were no fewer than 250 programmers in 36 countries getting payed to work professionally with Rails. There are now <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/WorkingProfessionallyWithRails">over 550 Rails programmers in 50 countries</a>, including Azerbaijan!</p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> was released it sold 6 thousand books in its first run. Six months later, its sales are over 25 thousand. Rails publishing is busy, with <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2006/01/23/oreillys-first-rails-book-premieres-in-beta-form">even</a> <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/articles/2005/12/17/ruby-for-rails-ruby-techniques-for-rails-developers">more</a> <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2006/01/14/rapid-web-development-mit-ruby-on-rails">titles</a> upcoming, such as the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a> cookbook, which is scheduled to be available in beta sometime this February.</p>
<p>There are now around 400 people in the <code>#rubyonrails</code> <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel, about the same as <code>#php</code>. The Rails mailing list is as <a href="http://blog.inquirylabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Rails%20and%20PHP%20mailing%20lists.png">busy as ever</a>.</p>
<p>Six months from now? The first annual <a href="http://railsconf.org">Rails Conference</a>. The next half year promises to be interesting. See you there.</p>
