<p>It&#8217;s time to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/20020102.html">upgrade to Ruby 1.8.2</a>, folks. Rails 0.10.0 includes various bits that require this version of Ruby, so if you want to run the latest Rails, you&#8217;ll have to get on the latest Ruby too. You&#8217;ll be glad you updated anyway. Ruby 1.8.2 contains a year&#8217;s worth of fixes, additions, and goodies from the Ruby masters. It&#8217;s an insult to them if don&#8217;t get jiggy with the goods (and Rails developers have other things to worry about that testing across old Ruby versions). Oh, when you upgrade, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/01/15/having-problems-running-tests-under-182/">be sure to patch test/unit</a>.</p>
