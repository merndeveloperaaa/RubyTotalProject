<p><a href="http://poocs.net/">Patrick Lenz</a> wrapped up yet another Rails book: <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/launch/5d3acfb/3/96">Build Your Own Ruby on Rails Web Applications</a>, published by SitePoint.  This one takes a beginners look at the Rails 1.2 framework, building a sample Digg-clone in the process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build Your Own Ruby on Rails Web Applications is an easy-to-follow, practical and fun guide to Ruby on Rails for beginners. It covers all you need to get up and running, from installing Ruby, Rails and MySQL to building and deploying a fully featured web application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Patrick posted a few <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/learn-ruby-on-rails">sample chapters</a> of the book at Sitepoint.</p>
