<p>Writeboards are collaborative documents with version control, difference tracking, and comments. They&#8217;re created through <a href="http://writeboard.com/">Writeboard.com</a>, the latest Rails application from 37signals. And if you happen to have a <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">Backpack</a>, you can even manage your Writeboards from there. It&#8217;s totally free and you can create as many Writeboards as you like.</p>
<p>The code underneath is currently 908 lines, according to &#8220;rake stats&#8221;.</p>
