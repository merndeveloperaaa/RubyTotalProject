<p><a href="http://www.rubypowerandlight.com">David A. Black&#8217;s</a>  book <a href="http://www.manning.com/black/">Ruby for Rails</a> is now available in full in <span class="caps">PDF</span> form (paper copy scheduled to follow the first week of May). The book covers the ins and outs of Ruby with a focus on Rails. It is aimed at Rails developers who want to gain a deeper understanding of Ruby beyond what Rails builds on top of it.</p>
<p>Taking a look at the <a href="http://www.manning.com/black/excerpt_contents.html">table of contents</a> you&#8217;ll get a sense of how much territory the book covers. There are two sample chapers for free. One is on <a href="http://www.manning-source.com/books/black/black_ch05.pdf">Organizing objects with classes</a> and the other on <a href="http://www.manning-source.com/books/black/black_ch10.pdf">Scalar objects</a>.</p>
<p>David Black is an ideal guide through Ruby,  having been a member of the community for over 5 years and as the director of <a href="http://rubycentral.org/">Ruby Central</a>, the not for profit organization that brings you <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a> every year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Ruby is one of the key ingredients in Rails&#8217; special sauce. If you are a Rails developer, you owe it to yourself to be a Ruby master. <a href="http://www.manning.com/black/">Ruby for Rails</a> is a great place to start.</p>
