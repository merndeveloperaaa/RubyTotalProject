<p><img src="http://macromates.com/images/headlights/logo.png" width="150" height="118" border="0" align="right" />Considering that <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> is the defacto standard for Rails development on OS X, I thought you might all like to know that there&#8217;s now <a href="http://macromates.com/textmate/manual/">a real manual</a> available for it. Explaining all about how you can make snippets, macros, and the rest of that sexy stuff you see sprinkled all over <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/screencasts">the Rails screencasts</a>.</p>
