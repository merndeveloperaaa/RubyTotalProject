<p>There&#8217;s a brand new version of Rails coming, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2009/2/1/rails-2-3-0-rc1-templates-engines-rack-metal-much-more">as you already know</a>. What better time for a new version of some of the Rails documentation? So the Rails Guides team is pleased to announce a refresh of the <a href="http://guides.rails.info">Ruby on Rails Guides</a> site, just in time for the Rails 2.3 release.</p>
<p>The most obvious change you&#8217;ll see is a new look, thanks to some awesome design work from <a href="http://www.thinkcage.com/">Jason Zimdars</a>. But the visual refresh isn&#8217;t all that&#8217;s going on here. We&#8217;ve also been working to update the Guides for Rails 2.3, as well as to add new guides to the list.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s good news if you want to get involved too. Behind the scenes, <a href="http://tore.darell.no">Tore</a> and Pratik switched our markup engine from AsciiDoc to Textile. This makes the Guides easier to write and edit and easier to build into a Rails project. If you&#8217;ve got some spare time to help out, join us in the #docrails room on irc.freenode.net, and help make the Rails Guides into a great resource in time for the 2.3 release.</p>
