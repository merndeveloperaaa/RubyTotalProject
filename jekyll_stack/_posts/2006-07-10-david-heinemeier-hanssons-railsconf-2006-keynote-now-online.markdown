<p>David&#8217;s RailsConf 2006 keynote, <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/pages/rails/">Discovering a World of Resources on Rails</a>, is now online.</p>
<p>In this talk he announced the new ActiveResource project, for consuming <span class="caps">REST</span> web services and evangelized his new infatuation with regimenting his domain into simple <span class="caps">CRUD</span> operations.</p>
<p>You can get the slides and a slice of David&#8217;s point of view on all this, over at <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000593.html">LoudThinking</a>.</p>
<p>For those twitching at the flash video player, <a href="http://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central</a> will be making the footage available in the future in an unflashy format.</p>
