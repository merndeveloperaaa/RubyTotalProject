<p>Congratulations to Scott Barron for <a href="http://scott.elitists.net/users/scott/posts/open-for-business">pursuing the life of the independent consultant</a>. Especially so, of course, because he&#8217;ll be doing it as a Ruby on Rails specialist. We already have a good handful of people following that round with great success. People like <a href="http://www.leetsoft.com/">Tobias Luekte</a> and <a href="http://bitsweat.net/">Jeremy Kemper</a> are overloaded with requests for work.</p>
<p>So basically, we need more warm bodies to follow up on all the leads we&#8217;re seeing. Now is definitely a good time to build a name for yourself in the Rails world and start staking your claim to the many opportunities bubbling up.</p>
<p>The best way to demonstrate your skills as a Ruby on Rails consultant worth his salt is to get intimate with the source, start <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com">contributing patches</a> (we have <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/report/9">lots of faults</a> to hunt down if you need an easy way in), and create a fully functional showcase application.</p>
<p>Scott is doing <a href="http://dev.elitists.textdriven.com/">Elite Journal, Scratch, Recipe Box, and Elite Album</a>. Tobias is cooking with <a href="http://www.hieraki.org/">Hieraki</a> and <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">Typo</a>. <a href="http://conio.net/">Sam</a> is behind the Javascript-engine <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a> for the new Ajax stuff.</p>
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s a brave new world of opportunities. The streets a covered with gold and honey is raining from the sky. Fortune and fame awaits. If we had the tech for it, there would be a flying billboard saying:</p>
<blockquote>A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies. The chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure</blockquote>
<p>The time is now!</p>
<p>(How&#8217;s that for an enthusiastic rally cry)</p>
