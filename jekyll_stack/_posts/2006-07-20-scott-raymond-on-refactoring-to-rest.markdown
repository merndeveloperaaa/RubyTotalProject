Gonzo Rails developer [Scott Raymond](http://scottraymond.net) has written [an analysis](http://scottraymond.net/articles/2006/07/20/refactoring-to-rest) of how he refactored [IconBuffet.com](http://www.iconbuffet.com) using [RESTful](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/plugins/simply_restful) routes. It's the most cogent and compelling description of the benefits of a CRUDdy/RESTful design that I've seen. He reduced the number of actions in the application by 25%, and reduced the size of his routes file from 16 lines to 3. Isn't small beautiful?
