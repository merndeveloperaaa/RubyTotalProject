<p>UC Berkeley is teaching Ruby on Rails in its <a href="http://radlab.cs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Cs198">CS198 Rad Labs class</a>. The class is being taught by <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/bio.html">Dave Patterson</a>, the creator of <span class="caps">RISC</span>, <span class="caps">SPARC</span>, <span class="caps">RAID</span>, and more. Quite an endorsement.</p>
