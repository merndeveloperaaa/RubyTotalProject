<p>Doing Test Driven Development (<span class="caps">TDD</span>) effectively is not something that comes easy, even when you&#8217;re working with a well structured Rails application.  Up until March of this year there really was no guide I could recommend for developers who wanted to learn <span class="caps">TDD</span> with Rails.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.railsrx.com/"><img src="/assets/2009/7/4/Test-Prescriptions_1.jpg" style="border: none;"/></a></p>
<p>What happened in March?  Noel Rappin released his <a href="http://www.railsrx.com/">Rails Test Prescriptions</a> <span class="caps">PDF</span> guide.  You can start out by reading his <span class="caps">FREE</span> 84 page <a href="http://www.railsrx.com/">Getting Started With Rails Testing</a> <span class="caps">PDF</span> Guide, and then maybe upgrade to his <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/e-book/rails_test_prescriptions/6418439">$9 dollar 286 page guide</a> which covers advanced topics like creating Test helpers, stubbing, mocking, and even how to use factories, shoulda, rspec, and cucumber.</p>
<p>Noel is a great teacher providing examples that are really easy to follow and code downloads if you want to try writing tests on your own.  So if you&#8217;re not doing testing yet or you want to learn some best practices, definitely check out <a href="http://www.railsrx.com/">Rails Prescriptions</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that Noel has posted some pretty interesting blog posts on the <a href="http://blog.railsprescriptions.com/">Rails Prescriptions Blog</a> going over a few testing topics and even some <a href="http://blog.railsprescriptions.com/interview">testing interviews</a> with developers like Chad Fowler, James Golick, Ryan Bates, and Mike Gunderloy.  Lastly I can&#8217;t talk about Noel without mentioning his contributions to the <a href="http://www.pathf.com/blogs/author/noel-rappin/">Pathfinder blog</a>, I&#8217;m a big fan of his blog posts.</p>
