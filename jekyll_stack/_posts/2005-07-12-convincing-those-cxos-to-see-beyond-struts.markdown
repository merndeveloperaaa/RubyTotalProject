<p><a href="http://raibledesigns.com/comments/rd/sunsets/scaling_with_rails">Matt Raible hopes to become a Ruby on Rails developer</a>, but has doubts on how exactly he&#8217;s going to convince CxO&#8217;s to see beyond Struts. Matt recognizes that it&#8217;s not about technology any more, but rather appearance. On the once golden &#8220;but will it scale?&#8221;, Matt writes:</p>
<blockquote>The one thing that I see time and time again is that Java developers don&#8217;t seem to realize that some of the highest traffic sites on the net are using <span class="caps">LAMP</span> stacks similar to what Rails advocates. <span class="caps">IMHO</span>, I don&#8217;t think &#8220;Rails can&#8217;t scale&#8221; is a valid argument. In fact, I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any argument or way to put down Rails anymore.</blockquote>
<p>So it&#8217;s not about scaling. Rather, Matt sees the problem as an appearance of being unable to hire:</p>
<blockquote>Try convincing a Fortune 500 company to program in Rails vs. Struts and they&#8217;ll probably choose Struts because there are thousands of Struts Developers. Is this a good decision on their part? I don&#8217;t think so. I think it&#8217;s more important to hire smart people that can learn a technology, rather than hiring those that know a technology. Of course, if someone knows a technology really well, there&#8217;s probably no harm in hiring them.</blockquote>
<p>Considering the nice flow of job applications we&#8217;ve been posting on this weblog and the growing number that has been appearing at places like craigslist, I&#8217;m pretty sure this is a mirage. I haven&#8217;t heard of anyone getting into Rails development that hasn&#8217;t been able to hire.</p>
<p>And the step from corporations like <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/06/30/ruby-on-rails-making-inroads-in-corporate-america/">Bank of America posting job listings with Rails</a> as a &#8220;nice to have&#8221; to &#8220;required&#8221; is not that big. And with <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/07/12/epson-chooses-rails-for-developer-site/">wins at places like <span class="caps">EPSON</span></a>, it gets even easier.</p>
