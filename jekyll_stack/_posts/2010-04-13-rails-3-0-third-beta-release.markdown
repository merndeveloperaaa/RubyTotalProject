<p>We&#8217;re marching towards the release candidates with hurried steps, but along the way we stopped by for another beta. This one spins out a few overdue extractions into plugins (see <a href="http://github.com/rails/verification">http://github.com/rails/verification</a> and <a href="http://github.com/rails/dynamic_form">http://github.com/rails/dynamic_form</a>), fixes a security issue with cookies, crosses a few t&#8217;s and dots a few i&#8217;s. Upgrading from beta 2 is recommended.</p>
<p>As always, you can install the latest beta with <code>gem install rails --pre</code>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see you again soon for the release candidate.</p>
