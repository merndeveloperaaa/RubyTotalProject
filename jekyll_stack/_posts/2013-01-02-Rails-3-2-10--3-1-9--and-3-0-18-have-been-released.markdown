Rails versions 3.2.10, 3.1.9, and 3.0.18 have been released.  These releases contain an important security fix.  It is recommended that **all users upgrade immediately**.

The security identifier is CVE-2012-5664, and you can read about the issue [here](https://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/c2353369fea8c53).

For other change in each particular release, please see the CHANGELOG corresponding to that version.  For all commits in each release, please follow the links below:

* [Changes in 3.2.10](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.2.9...v3.2.10)
* [Changes in 3.1.9](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.1.8...v3.1.9)
* [Changes in 3.0.18](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.17...v3.0.18)

We're sorry to drop a release like this so close to the holidays but regrettably the exploit has already been publicly disclosed and we don't feel we can delay the release.

To that end, we've minimized the number of changes in each release so that upgrading should be as smooth as possible.

Happy Holidays!
