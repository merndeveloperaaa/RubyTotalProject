<p>Oracle continues blow loving kisses at Rails. This time they&#8217;ve posted a new <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/saternos-ror-faq.html"><span class="caps">FAQ</span> on how to get Rails and Oracle out on the first date</a>. Initial installation and a hello world application is covered.</p>
