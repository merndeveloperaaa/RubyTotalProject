Ahoy there, rapscallion.

We're just about to depart for our weekly voyage on the sea of Rails news - beware the great snark!

Captain [Kasper](https://twitter.com/kaspth) abides seas and appeases gods in hopes we make it ashore.

Come aboard and let's cast away.

## Featured

### [Rails crossed 50,000 commits](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19128)

Our backs are all red from the pats given when news broke of Rails having more than 50,000 commits.  
Adding to that chalupa 42 chummy contributors crossed the web and [helped out](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/this-week).

### [10+ Years of Rails with DHH](http://thechangelog.com/145)

Listen in as David takes a trip down memory lane. Hear why he made Rails and get some stories on the early days of Rails contributing. He also has some thoughts about money and open source. It might not be such a good thing to get paid to work on open source, after all.

### [Rails & Google Summer of Code 2015](https://rubyonrails.org/2015/3/4/google-summer-of-code-2015)

Speaking of being paid for open source, Rails will be part of this year's GSoC. I was a student two years ago and wouldn't be here without it.

I highly recommend doing your [research](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-gsoc/TR5EUPpWLck). Submit an honest [proposal](https://github.com/kaspth/gsoc-application) and you just might [make it](https://rubyonrails.org/2013/5/27/rails-google-summer-of-code-projects).

## Seagulls of the Sea

### [Damn Winged Creatures in my Newsletter](https://www.google.dk/search?q=seagull&biw=1147&bih=741&tbm=isch&source=lnt&tbs=isz:ex,iszw:120,iszh:120#tbm=isch&q=seagulls+on+the+sea&imgdii=_)

There we were. Having a nice day on the deck and a seagull wants to join in on the fun of staring at peaceful waters. Not on my watch.

Return to the sea, beast!

## New Stuff

### [Added restart rake task](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18965)

Rails 5 brings a restart Dr. Frankenstein would be envious of. The new rake restart command will knock your app out cold and zap it back to life.

### [Enumerable#without](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19157)

We also got a new Enumerable method to quickly rid of us stuff harmful to humans: `[:whooping_cough, :vaccine, :measles].without(:vaccine)`.

Finally, we can [sleep easy](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/511909639274123264).
