<p>You may already know Josh Susser from his excellent blog <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/">has_many :through</a>.  After linking up 5 of his posts in a row we figured it would be easier to cut out the middle man so we&#8217;ve brought him on board to be one of the contributors to the Rails weblog.</p>
<p>Rails weblog readers this is Josh, Josh the readers of the Rails weblog&#8230;</p>
