<p>Despite my recent <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000407.html">case against high-level components</a>, I do find low-to-medium level components useful when restricted within a narrow context. I could easily foresee abstracting some of the stuff in our 37signals applications into components and then reuse them across our similar products.</p>
<p>But what ever you believe that components will herald the second coming or remain skeptical as I, the infrastructure to build and use components have now come to Rails! It&#8217;s incredibly easy to use and components can either render complete screens or parts of other screens.</p>
<p>To demonstrate I&#8217;ve made a little movie: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/media/videos/clips/components.mov">Components in Rails</a>.</p>
<p>Components will be part of the forth coming Rails 0.10.0 release (which is due any day now).</p>
