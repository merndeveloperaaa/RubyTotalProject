<p>There won&#8217;t be a Living on the Edge this week, but you won&#8217;t be starved for info because the Rails community is keeping up.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryandaigle.com/">Ryan Daigle</a> has been keeping up with some of the changes on edge Rails and has done a few awesome explanatory posts on them:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/7/16/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-memoization">Easy memoization with ActiveSupport::Memoizable</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/7/19/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-nested-models">Nested model mass assignments</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/7/19/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-get-ur-metaclass">Metaclass accessor</a> (aka the eigenclass)</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps even more noteworthy is the introduction of I18n (internationalization) support to Rails core. Sven Fuchs explains the <a href="http://www.artweb-design.de/2008/7/18/the-ruby-on-rails-i18n-core-api">technical details and <span class="caps">API</span></a> as well as the <a href="http://www.artweb-design.de/2008/7/18/finally-ruby-on-rails-gets-internationalized">history of Rails and I18n</a>. I18n support is scheduled to be fully stable in the Rails 2.2 release. Have an interest in internationalization in Rails? Lend a hand with your ideas, feedback, and patches at the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rails-i18n">Google Group</a>.</p>
