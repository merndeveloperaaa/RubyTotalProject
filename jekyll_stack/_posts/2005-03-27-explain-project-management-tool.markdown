<p>eXtreme Programming and Ruby on Rails is a wonderful fit. Besides the most excellent support for test-driven development, XP works a whole lot better when your code base is so small that breakthroughs in knowledge about the domain can be executed in as few refactorings as possible.</p>
<p>But if you want to get into XP, you naturally also have to get into the planning game. And that&#8217;s where the newly released <a href="http://explainpmt.com/">eXPlain Project Management Tool</a> by <a href="http://pulpblog.com/">John Wilger</a> (with help from Jim Weirich and Quentin Baker) comes in. Through a simple interface, you can manage stories, iterations, and milestones.</p>

<p>Wilger and friends even had the good sense to put up a <a href="http://demo.explainpmt.com/">demo application</a> (admin/adminadmin) for you to try out.</p>
