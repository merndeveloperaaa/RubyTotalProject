<p>Never thought you&#8217;d hear that, eh? But that&#8217;s exactly what <a href="http://unspun.amazon.com">unspun.amazon.com</a> is. A Rails application sitting on the Amazon.com domain. Adam Selipsky from Amazon Web Services introduces the site with this:</p>
<blockquote> UnSpun helps you to find and create ranked lists by gathering votes from workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk and from the UnSpun community. We show the popular opinion, with no &#8220;spin&#8221; (hence the name) &#8212; along with links to websites with more information about the particular items on the list.  If you don&#8217;t see the list you are looking for, simply create it and rankings will start populating within a few minutes. 2,294 ranked lists are already on UnSpun, holding 640,107 items, with more coming in all the time.</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to the <span class="caps">AWS</span> team at Amazon!</p>
<p>Coming shortly, we&#8217;ll have a bunch of other announcements for high-profile companies going Ruby on Rails for various new projects. Exciting times.</p>
