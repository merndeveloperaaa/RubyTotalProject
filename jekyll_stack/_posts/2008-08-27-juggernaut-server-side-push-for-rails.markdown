<p><a href="http://juggernaut.rubyforge.org/">Juggernaut</a> is a combination of a small Ruby server, a Flash bridge, and a plugin that makes it easy to do server-side push systems in Rails. I played with this idea with Rich Killmer a few years ago and even made a small demo system to present at a conference, but never made it to the finish line of something releasable. So it&#8217;s fantastic to see that the guys behind Juggernaut did.</p>
