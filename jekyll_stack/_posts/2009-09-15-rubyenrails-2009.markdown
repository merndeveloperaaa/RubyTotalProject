<p><a href="http://2009.rubyenrails.nl/?locale=en">RubyEnRails 2009</a> goes down this 30/31 October in Amsterdam. Talks are in English and Dutch.</p>
<p>RubyEnRails has been all-volunteer for four years running, building on a history of sweet venues, good talks, and great company. It&#8217;s gradually grown from a local gathering to a full-fledged European event, and this year it&#8217;s also stepping up to fill the shoes of RailsConf EU.</p>
<p>Yehuda and I are speaking and will be mixing a potent batch of Rails 3 kool-aid. Please join us for a sip!</p>
