<p><a href="http://luckymonk.com/">Luckymonk</a> escaped their .<span class="caps">NET</span> entanglement and found Ruby on Rails, but they still have to live in a Windows world. Now they&#8217;re putting on <a href="http://workshop.softiesonrails.com/">a workshop</a> teaching you how to do the same. It&#8217;s in Chicago and it&#8217;s almost sold out.</p>
<p>Usually we don&#8217;t mention workshops any more (there are so many), but I thought it would be nice to shine some light on one of the lesser published transitions. The one from .<span class="caps">NET</span> to Ruby on Rails. We got plenty of stories of how <span class="caps">PHP</span> and Java folks are jumping ship, so its great to hear how it&#8217;s happening from the Microsoft camp too.</p>
