<p><a href="https://www.bountysource.com">Bounty Source</a> provides the Open Source community with free hosting and tools including a task manager, a <span class="caps">CMS</span>, and a Subversion Code Repository.  They&#8217;ve been gracious enough to release the <a href="https://bssvnbrowser.bountysource.com/">Subversion Browser</a> as a Rails plugin.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve posted a <a href="http://rails.techno-weenie.net/tip/2006/5/31/adding_authentication_to_bssvnbrowser">technique</a> on <a href="http://rails.techno-weenie.net">Rails Weenie</a> on using your application&#8217;s authentication scheme on the plugin, so that your <em>secret sauce</em> is not available to the whole world.</p>
