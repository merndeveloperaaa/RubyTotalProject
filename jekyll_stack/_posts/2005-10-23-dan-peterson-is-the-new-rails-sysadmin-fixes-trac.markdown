<p>Our trusty Rails server Wrath was generating cruft and crust faster than you could say we-have-no-sysadmin, so at RubyConf we decided to remedy the situation and ask for help. Dan Peterson stepped up to the plate and is now officially the new Rails systems administrator. Welcome on board, mate!</p>
<p>And wasting little time, he has already cleaned a few rough corners for performance and, more importantly, upgraded and fixed Trac &#8212; the software that runs <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/">dev.rubyonrails.com</a>. So no more timeouts, better performance, more features.</p>
