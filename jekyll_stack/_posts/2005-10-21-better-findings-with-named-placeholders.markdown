<p>Robby on Rails has a great introduction to <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com:8680/articles/2005/10/21/using-named-placeholders-in-ruby">named placeholders</a> in Rails. Making ActiveRecord::Base.find more readable and secure at the same time, what&#8217;s not to like? Please Robby, or someone else, turn a succinct version of this argument into a documentation patch.</p>
