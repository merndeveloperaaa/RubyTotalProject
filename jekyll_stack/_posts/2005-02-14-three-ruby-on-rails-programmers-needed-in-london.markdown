<p>Sean O&#8217;Halpin is <a href="http://one.textdrive.com/pipermail/rails/2005-February/002984.html">advertising</a> on the Rails mailing list for three Ruby on Rails programmers for work in central London, UK. Here&#8217;s the short pitch:</p>
<blockquote>I am looking for 3 permanent top notch Ruby developers &#8211; 2 senior and 1 intermediate &#8211; to work in central London, UK. I head up a small group of programmers who produce business applications in-house for a large communications agency in the advertising market. Demand for our services is growing so we need to expand our team.</blockquote>
<p>The requirements for the two senior positions are:</p>
<blockquote>The senior programmers need 5+ years experience in a variety of languages and platforms dealing with the full project lifecycle in a variety of domains. You will be expected to gather requirements, design systems and manage a project from start to finish. You will report to me, the System Architect.</blockquote>
<p>&#8230;and for the intermediate position:</p>
<blockquote>The intermediate programmer will be reporting to one of the seniors and should have 3+ years experience and be confident in team leading and administrative skills. Your role will be to support the seniors and to be sysadmin for the team.</blockquote>
