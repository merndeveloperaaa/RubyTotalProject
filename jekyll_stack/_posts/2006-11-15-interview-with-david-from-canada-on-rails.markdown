<p>Better late than never, the InfoQ team has finally released an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/David-Hansson">interview done with yours truly</a> back in April at Canada on Rails. It includes questions like &#8220;How long until you are the vendor?&#8221; and &#8220;WS-* is that bullshit?&#8221; and many more fun themes. The questioner is <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie">Obie Fernandez</a>.</p>
