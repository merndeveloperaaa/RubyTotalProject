<p><img src="/assets/2006/11/13/beginningecommerce.jpg" align="right" />Christian Hellsten and Jarkko Laine&#8217;s new book has hit the shelves: <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10178">Beginning Ruby on Rails E-Commerce</a>. Their pitch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning Ruby on Rails E-Commerce: From Novice to Professional is the first book of its kind to guide you through producing e-commerce applications with Rails—the stacked web framework taking the world by storm. The book dives right into the process of creating a production-level web application using agile methodologies and test-driven development combined with Rails best practices. You’ll take advantage of the latest crop of Rails plug-ins and helpers that will radically improve your programming schedule. You’ll also create a real application step-by-step, plus the book is driven by real-world cases throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also get it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Ruby-Rails-E-Commerce-Professional/dp/1590597362/">straight from Amazon</a>. Congratulations to both authors on completing the book.</p>
