<p>Alongside EliteJournal, Epilog is the other major weblog application development going on with Rails. Marten is set to release a new version running off the 0.9.x series of Rails in &#8220;&#8230;a week, two at most&#8221;, but you can already Trac along as Marten just set up shop at <a href="http://dev-epilog.standardbehaviour.com/">dev-epilog.standardbehaviour.com</a>.</p>
<p>For a small taste of what&#8217;s to come, <a href="http://www.markijbema.nl/blog/">Mark IJbema</a> is blogging using the in-development version of Epilog. Note the small promising details like human times in the form of &#8220;just after midnight&#8221;. Promising stuff!</p>
