<p>Obviously someone forgot to tell Tobi and crew that its impossible to do internationalization with Rails. Otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t have been so foolish as to try. And now look what has become of it? <a href="http://blog.jadedpixel.com/2006/9/1/shopify-s-checkout-goes-international">Shopify checkout in multiple languages</a>. Even Scottish!</p>

<p>All joking aside, congratulations to jaded Pixel. We&#8217;re eagerly awaiting the write-up on how you guys went international.</p>
