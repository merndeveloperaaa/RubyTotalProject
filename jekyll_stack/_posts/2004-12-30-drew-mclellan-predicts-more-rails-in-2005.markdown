<p>Among predictions of having a beard will be the hot thing in 2005, Mr. All in the Head <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/242/">highlights Rails</a> as having an especially bright coming year:</p>
<blockquote>David Heinemeier Hansson&rsquo;s Rails framework for web application development in Ruby is set to hit the magic v1.0 in early 2005. Rails is really picking up momentum, and for good reason. It&rsquo;s the web app dev framework for the <span class="caps">MVC</span> generation, or something. If you haven&rsquo;t checked it out yet &#8211; especially if you do a lot of big development in dynamic languages such as <span class="caps">PHP</span> &#8211; do so.</blockquote>
