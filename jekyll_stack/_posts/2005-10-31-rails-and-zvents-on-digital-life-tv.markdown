<p>Tyler Kovacs, <span class="caps">CTO</span> of Zvents, had a great segment in the <a href="http://digitallifetv.com/blogs/digitallifetv/archive/2005/10/18/1392.aspx">DigitalLife TV episode 10</a> where he got to showcase his Rails application and talk about Ruby on Rails and Ajax in general. Thanks a bunch for the kind words, Tyler. It&#8217;s great to see Rails getting some TV coverage.</p>
