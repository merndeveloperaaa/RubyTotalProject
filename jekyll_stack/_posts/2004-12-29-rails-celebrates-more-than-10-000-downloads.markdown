<p>Across all versions and distributions forms, Rails have now rounded <strong>10,000 downloads</strong> since the first version was released just five months ago. That&#8217;s an incredible achievement for a new framework to reach in such a short period of time, but if things go as they should, we should be celebrating 100,000 downloads in another five months (world domination doesn&#8217;t occur by modesty, now does it ;)).</p>
<p>Thanks to all the contributors who helped make Rails a desirable package. Thanks to all the companies that took a chance with a new kind of productivity. Thanks to all the many users who made it interesting to release new versions.</p>
<p>And of course thanks to the live community hanging out on #rubyonrails and rails@lists.rubyonrails.org. Keeping the energy at a staggering high day by day.</p>
