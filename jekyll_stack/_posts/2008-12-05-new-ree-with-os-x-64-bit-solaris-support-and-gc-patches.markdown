<p><a href="http://www.phusion.nl/">Phusion</a> is on a roll today. Not only did we just get a new Passenger, they&#8217;ve also just dropped a <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/2008/12/05/ruby-enterprise-edition-186-20081205-released-thank-you-sponsors/">new <span class="caps">REE</span></a> (the Ruby patches for copy-on-write) that includes 64-bit support as well as compatibility with OS X and Solaris. They&#8217;ve also fitted the excellent RailsBench patches from Stefan Kaes that allows you to tweak the GC settings in Ruby if you need to.</p>
