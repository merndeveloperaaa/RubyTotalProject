<p>Dave Thomas has just announced that the first release-candidate of <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a> is now available. What that means is that the book is essentially in its finished form. It&#8217;s had a great beta run, with a lot of praise and good feedback. Now that it&#8217;s been put through its passes, it&#8217;s pretty much ready for primetime, sporting 70 solutions to your real world programming challenges. If you&#8217;ve been holding off, now is a great time to get in on what is shaping up to be the de facto companion to <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>.</p>
<p>If you already bought the <span class="caps">PDF</span>, you can <a href="http://books.pragprog.com/titles/fr_rr/reorder">get the latest copy for free</a>.</p>
