<p>After an extended period of troublesome Trac times, we&#8217;ve finally addressed the problem once and for all. Courtesy of TextDrive, we now have a new mega-powerful super machine dedicated to Trac and <span class="caps">SVN</span>. Instead of loads in the 30&#8217;es, it&#8217;s now below 1. So get all of your pending patches and tickets into the system. It now actually works.</p>
<p>And thanks to the move of the mailing list to Google Groups, there&#8217;s still enough power on the old server to run the wiki, the manuals site, and the weblog without slowdowns. We ruffled a few feathers during the move (some people took it harder than others, one guy wanted to hunt down and kill the responsible, eeks!), but we&#8217;re happy to report that in terms of providing breathing room for the overloaded servers, it worked like a charm.</p>
