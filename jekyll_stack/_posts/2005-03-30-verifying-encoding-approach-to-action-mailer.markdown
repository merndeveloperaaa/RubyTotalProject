<p>If you&#8217;re deep into all the RFCs on email, we&#8217;d like your help ensuring that the latest approach to encoding with Action Mailer is sound. We&#8217;re going for an approach where encoding to subjects and headers are only applied if necessary. Please do have a look at <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/ticket/955">ticket #955</a>.</p>
