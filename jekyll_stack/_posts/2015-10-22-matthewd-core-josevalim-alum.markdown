Please join us in welcoming <a href="https://github.com/matthewd">Matthew Draper</a> to the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/core/">Rails core team</a>!

Matthew is a kick-ass collaborator. He's gone above and beyond PRs and <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/matthew-draper/commits">technical contributions</a> (which are sharp and on-point) by mentoring <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OpenAcademyProgram">student</a> <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">groups</a>, by coaching beginning Rails developers through their first apps alongside experienced developers working through design decisions & tradeoffs, by <s>volunteering for</s>serving on the Rails security team, and by emerging as a natural steward of the Rails way. His mindfulness for programmer experience & happiness puts Rails‚Äîthe framework and our community‚Äîin good hands. Welcome, Matthew! üëè

Also, please join us in ushering <a href="https://github.com/josevalim">Jos√© Valim</a> into the halls of <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/core/alumni/">Rails alumni</a>. Jos√© was once a <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/jose-valim/commits">Rails patch monster</a> without peer, and has gone on to create the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> programming language and build a fantastic community around it. Gratefully, for everything: Thank you, Jos√©. ‚ù§Ô∏è
