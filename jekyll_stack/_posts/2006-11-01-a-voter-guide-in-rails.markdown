In the United States, elections are coming up next week. [Radical Designs](http://radicaldesigns.org), a Rails development shop in San Francisco, has put together a site (using Rails) to let voters build, share, and view voter guides: [TheBallot.org](http://theballot.org). Ballots in US elections can be long and complicated, so many groups make voter guides to help sort through the issues. If you're curious, PodTech did a videolog interview about the [building of TheBallot.org](http://www.podtech.net/home/technology/1376/lunchmeet-gets-political-with-theballotorg).
