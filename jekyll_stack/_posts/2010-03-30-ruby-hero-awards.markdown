<p>It&#8217;s that time again to take a moment to think about those people who have impacted Ruby community but have not received the recognition they deserve.  We have given away twelve awards in the past two years at Railsconf, and this year we are preparing to give away six more.</p>
<h2>But we need your help.</h2>
<p>So, if you know someone who has contributed to our community this year please take a moment to show some gratitude by nominating them on <a href="http://rubyheroes.com">RubyHeroes.com</a>.  A month from now the <a href="http://rubyheroes.com/heroes">Ruby Heroes from last year</a> will look at the nominations and decide who should receive the awards (this way there&#8217;s no popularity contest).  However, your nominations do matter, so please <a href="http://rubyheroes.com">take a moment</a> and spread the gratitude.</p>
<p>The winners will be announced live on stage at <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010">Railsconf 2010</a>, and posted here shortly there after.</p>
