<p>Although Apache is the default choice of web server for Rails, it is by now means tied to it. Any web server that&#8217;s capable of doing a wee bit of rewriting in front and handling FastCGI applications can run Rails. Lighttpd is just one such web server.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in trying that out, TJ Vanderpoel has written an <a href="http://bougyman.com/miscfiles/RailsonDebian.html">extensive tutorial</a> on how to get Rails running with Lighttpd using FastCGI on Debian.</p>
