<p>Scott Barron has taken Ruby on Rails on the air. Listen to the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails Podcast</a>:</p>
<blockquote>On the show we will delve deep into the warped psyches of the members of the Rails core team. We&#8217;ll talk about news related to Rails and the web devlopment communities in general. We&#8217;ll talk about tips and tricks you can use to to write better Rails applications, and become a better person.</blockquote>
