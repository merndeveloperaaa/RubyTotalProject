<p><a href="http://cusec2006.soen.info/"><span class="caps">CUSEC</span> 2006</a> in Montreal this past January featured a great line up of speakers including <a href="http://chadfowler.com">Chad Fowler</a>, <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a> and <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>.</p>
<p>Except snow storms in the midwest kept David from making it, so with 12 hours of advanced notice, <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a> author Chad Fowler flexed his jazz improv background by whipping up an entertaining, wise and cool-as-cucumber talk in place of David&#8217;s keynote. The result is <a href="http://media41c.libsyn.com/podcasts/kopanas/001_chad_fowler.m4a">Rails is Boring and Ruby is a Toy</a>.</p>
