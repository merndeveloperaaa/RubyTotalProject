<p>The Australian version of ComputerWorld has a great article about <a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1935376066;fp;16;fpid;0">how Ruby on Rails is helping Spin Technologies</a> migrate school portal schoolseek.com.au get off .<span class="caps">NET</span>. Jordan Brock speaks about how fast Rails is to get started with and recommends that others get going by doing a small application first. Good advice and great to see Rails making headlines down under.</p>
