<p><a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/">RailsConf Europe</a> is approaching fast. It&#8217;s going down September 17-19 in Berlin, as most of you know, but this very week is actually the last if you want to take advantage of the 150 euro-discount for <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/pub/w/61/register.html">early-bird registrations</a>.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see everyone in Berlin. We had such a great conference in London last year and so much has happened since then. Have a look <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/railseurope2007/schedule/">at the program</a> and hopefully we&#8217;ll get a chance to meet up and talk.</p>
