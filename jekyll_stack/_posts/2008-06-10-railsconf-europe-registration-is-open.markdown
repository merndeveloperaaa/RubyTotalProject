<p><a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/">RailsConf Europe</a> has opened the doors for registration. The conference is returning to Berlin, Germany from September 2nd through 4th. If you register before July 15th, you can save up to 150 euros.</p>
<p>Considering what a blow-out success we had at RailsConf in Portland just a few weeks ago, it&#8217;s hard not to be pretty darn excited about setting up in Berlin and extending that good atmosphere across the pond. Berlin was a great spot in September last year as well.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting up with more from the European Rails communities. Hopefully the very large Danish delegation will make it down this year as well :).</p>
