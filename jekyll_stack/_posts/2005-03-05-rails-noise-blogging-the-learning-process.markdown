<p>Tim Germer is learning Rails and liking it so much that he decided to start a blog about the experience. And such was <a href="http://rails.timgermer.com/">Rails Noise</a> born. As background for his interest in Rails, Tim writes:</p>
<blockquote>I&rsquo;m no programming whiz-bang; I can muck around, and mucking I have been doing. Recently Ruby on Rails caught my attention. My attention has something to admit, it&rsquo;s biased towards those that innovate and stand out from the crowd. I know, I know, what an affliction I have!</blockquote>
