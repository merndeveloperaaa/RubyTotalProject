<p>Paul Graham delivered one of the keynotes to an audience of about 550 people this weekend at <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a>. The text of his talk, <a href="http://digg.com/programming/The_Power_of_the_Marginal">The Power of the Marginal</a>, is now online. Hold tight for full video of almost all the keynotes in weeks to come. They will be made available for free to download.</p>
<p>For now, relive the weekend or catch up to what went down with a bunch of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/railsconf/">pictures</a> and <a href="http://www.bloggingrailsconf.com/">commentary</a>.</p>
