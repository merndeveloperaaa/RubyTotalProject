<p>Zed Shaw put together a simple <a href="http://207.237.211.198:3000/recipe/list">proof of concept application</a> in a couple of hours to demonstrate the possibilities for rich clients in Rails and <span class="caps">XUL</span>. Being <span class="caps">XUL</span>, it naturally only works in Firefox and Mozilla, and being proof of concept, it still has plenty of stuff missing. But it does provide a window into the kind of applications Rails are capable of powering if you&#8217;re willing to limit the application to the Mozilla platform.</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> Zed has <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/programming/ruby_xul.html">explained</a> how the prototype works and offers a few suggestions for Rails.</p>
