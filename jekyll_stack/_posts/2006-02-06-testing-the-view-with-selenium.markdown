<p><a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> enables you to test the view by driving it through a real browser. This allows you to test that your application works correctly in multiple browsers and that the Javascript functions as intended. Very nifty stuff.</p>
<p>And Jonas Bengtsson just made the use of Selenium with Rails all the much easier through the <a href="http://andthennothing.net/archives/2006/02/05/selenium-on-rails">new Selenium plugin</a>. This removes the drudgery of setup and makes it silly simple to get started.</p>
