<p><a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a> has been a personal long-time favorite, so I&#8217;m delighted to hear that their latest redesign features a backend that&#8217;s entirely done in Rails. Woop. Gabe, who&#8217;s obviously not the programmer behind the engine, <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2005/11/14/">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Along with the slick new visuals the guts of the site also got a huge upgrade. Penny Arcade right now represents one of the largest implementations of &#8220;rails&#8221; on the intertron. I went and looked at a website about rails and then I got a headache. From what I gathered it&rsquo;s either some kind of cutting edge programming language, or a way to liquefy a man&rsquo;s brain inside his skull. I&#8217;m told that it means the site looks better and loads faster regardless of whatever hippy web browser you decide to use. Fuck M$!</blockquote>
