<p><a href="http://blog.railsapphosting.com/">RailsAppHosting</a> is an incredibly promising turn-key hosting environment that makes it a snap to setup a new application complete with database and subversion repository through a web interface. What won me over to its lure was <a href="http://blog.railsapphosting.com/articles/2005/08/07/first-movie-available">the video of using the system</a>. Man, that looks easy!</p>
<p>And now the team is <a href="http://blog.railsapphosting.com/articles/2005/08/23/were-partnering-with-textdrive">hooking up with Rails-hoster extraordinaire TextDrive</a>, so you get the easy of their interface with the backing of the TextDrive team. Can&#8217;t wait to see it go on the air.</p>
