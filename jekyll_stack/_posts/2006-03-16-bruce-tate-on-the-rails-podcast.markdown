<p>While down in Austin for <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></a>, <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a> caught up with <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/batate/">Bruce Tate</a> for the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails podcast</a>. Bruce talks about how Rails is the catalyst behind a sea change in the development world. Download as <a href="http://paranode.com/~topfunky/audio/2006/Bruce-Tate.mp3">mp3</a> or <a href="http://paranode.com/~topfunky/audio/2006/Bruce-Tate.m4a">mp4</a>.</p>
<p>A long time Java developer, earlier this year Bruce put out a book called <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/beyondjava/">Beyond Java</a> which caused quite a stir.</p>
<p>He also just wrote an article for IBM&#8217;s <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/">developer Works</a> about Active Record aimed at Java developers called <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-cb03076/?ca=dgr-lnxw">Crossing Borders: Exploring Active Record</a> .</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for his upcoming <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_j2r/">Java to Ruby</a> book. Your boss will thank you for alerting him/her to it one day.</p>
