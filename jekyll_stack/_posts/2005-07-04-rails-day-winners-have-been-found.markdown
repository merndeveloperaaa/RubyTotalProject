<p>The 24 hours allotted to create an interesting Rails application from scratch yielded a ton of create entries to Rails Day. The <a href="http://railsday.com/blog/">three winners have now been declared</a>, along with the three runner-ups, and honorable mentioning. Congratulation to the winners and to all who completed an application for Rails Day. Everyone learning Rails wins too as all entries are available with full source code.</p>
