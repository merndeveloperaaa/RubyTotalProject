<p>It&#8217;s that time again to take a moment to think about those who have impacted the Ruby community this year but have not received the recognition they deserve.  We have given away <a href="http://www.rubyheroes.com/heroes" title="Previous Ruby Heroes">eighteen awards</a> in the past three years at Railsconf, and this year we are preparing to give away six more.</p>
<h2>But we need your help.</h2>
<p>So, if you know someone who has contributed greatly this year please take a moment to show some gratitude by nominating them on <a href="http://rubyheroes.com">RubyHeroes.com</a>.  In two weeks the <a href="http://rubyheroes.com/heroes">Ruby Heroes from last year</a> will look at the nominations and decide who should receive the awards (this way there&#8217;s no popularity contest).  However, your nominations do matter, so please <a href="http://rubyheroes.com">take a moment</a> and spread the gratitude.</p>
<p>The winners will be announced live on stage at <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2011">Railsconf 2011</a>.</p>
