Happy Friday everyone!

The Rails team has just released [the second Release Candidate of Rails 4.2.0][gem]
today. For an overview of all the major changes in the 4.2 series, please refer
to the [release notes][release-notes].

The RC2 release includes some patches for a few minor issues that was reported
in the last week. It also includes some improvements to the documentation and
some enhancements that decreases the verbosity of the Active Job logs. You can
refer to [the diff on Github][commits] for a full list of changes.

We would like to thank you again for assisting our team in testing the release
candidates. Please continue to report any issues you discovered to our
[issue tracker][tracker] and/or notify the maintainers of the relevant gems and
plugins.

If no other major issues are found, we expect to release the final version of
4.2.0 very soon, just in time for Christmas!
