<p><a href="http://www.globalize-rails.org">www.globalize-rails.org</a> is the new home for the Globalize plugin that brings i18n functionality to Rails. They&#8217;re tackling everything from translations of model data, to proper formating of local times, and much anything in between. Velbekommen!</p>
