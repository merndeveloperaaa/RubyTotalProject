<p>As mentioned <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2006/05/18/weekly-interactive-guides-with-kevin-clark">last week</a>,  <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/">Kevin Clark</a> is taking your suggestions and developing weekly guides that cover the ins and outs of Rails.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s delivered on his first guide: <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/05/22/guide-environments-in-rails-1-1">Environments in Rails 1.1</a>.        The accompaying <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/05/22/configuring-rails-environments-the-cheat-sheet">Cheat Sheet</a> is particularly noteworthy. It lists all the various configuration options available to you, with a brief description of the purpose they serve.</p>
