<p>With Rails in a constant state of evolution, it&#8217;s important for its users to help each other stay in step with what&#8217;s current.  To that end, <a href="http://www.conorhunt.com/techblog/">Conor Hunt</a> has created <a href="http://rannotate.rubyforge.org/">Rannotate</a>, a system for collaboratively annotating RDoc-generated documentation.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s gone a step further and posted Rannotate instances for both <a href="http://rails.outertrack.com/">Rails</a> and <a href="http://ruby.outertrack.com/">Ruby</a>.</p>
<p>Read, post, learn, and teach.  At critical mass, Conor&#8217;s service could provide a huge benefit to the community.  Coupled with <a href="http://glu.ttono.us">Kevin Clark&#8217;s</a> Rails documentation crusade, things are looking better and better on the documentation front.</p>
<p>These guys deserve our appreciation and our support.  Now <a href="http://rails.outertrack.com">go post some annotations</a>!</p>
