Jay Zimmerman just wrote to say that next Wednesday, July 26th, the presentation media for [RailsConf 2006](http://www.railsconf.org) will go on sale to the general public.  So if you didn't get to the conference, you can pick up all the slides with synced audio for $100.  Surf on over to the [ScribeStudio](http://blog.scribestudio.com/pages/rails) site for more information.  And remember, videos of the seven keynote presentations are being made available for [free download](http://blog.scribestudio.com/pages/rails) too.
