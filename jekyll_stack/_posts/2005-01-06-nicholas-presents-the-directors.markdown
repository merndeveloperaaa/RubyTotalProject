<p>Nicholas Seckar is busy working away on the Directors &#8212; the next-generation <span class="caps">URL</span> mapping scheme for Rails &#8212; yet still took the time to explain how its going to work. Of course, he chose to use the newly launched SoapBX: <a href="http://www.soapbx.com/viewer/show/34">Rails &amp; Rewriting</a>. Most excellent.</p>
