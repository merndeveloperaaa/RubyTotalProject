<p>Regional Rails conferences are popping up all over the place. On November 17th, <a href="http://paris.onrails.info/">Paris on Rails</a> will go down. It looks like it&#8217;ll be a great show for all French speaking people out there. And they got some nice sponsors lined up, such as <span class="caps">IBM</span> and Telecom Italia. Way to go.</p>
<p>If you want to sign up, the fee is 60 euro.</p>
