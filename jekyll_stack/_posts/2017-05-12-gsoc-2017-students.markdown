We are super excited to announce our accepted Google Summer of Code students
for 2017. Welcome [Marko] and [Assain]! They will hack on Rails for the summer.

## [Marko Bogdanović][Marko]

[Marko] will be implementing and improving long running benchmarks for Ruby and
Rails. He will be mentored by [Jon], [Robin] and [Noah].

## [Assain Jaleel][Assain]

[Assain] is going to refresh the cookie system in Rails. He'll be mentored by
[Kasper] with help from [Michael Coyne].

## Thank You
