<p>Eric Hodel was so kind as to show me the output of <code>rake stats</code> on <a href="http://43things.com">43things</a> and it revealed that it took 5,204 lines of Ruby to create the current version. That&#8217;s pretty darn amazing considering they&#8217;re not even taking full advantage of the huge array of improvements in Rails 0.9.x and that the team consists of three out of four programmers new to Ruby.</p>
<p>Another round of applauds to the team at The Robot Co-op for creating such an interesting application in so few lines. Kudos!</p>
