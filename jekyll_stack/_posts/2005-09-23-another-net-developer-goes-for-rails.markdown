<p>Garret Dimon has a <a href="http://www.garrettdimon.com/archives/why-i-love-ruby-on-rails">great explanation for why .<span class="caps">NET</span> is no longer his preferred tool</a> for web development and why Ruby on Rails is. On Best Practices, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>Rails takes all of the things you should be doing, and consolidates it into one very elegant framework. Directory structure, unit testing, functional testing, performance testing, database build scripts, <span class="caps">MVC</span> separation, validation, no <span class="caps">XML</span> configuration files, and more. It&rsquo;s all there, and it all plays together nicely. This is my favorite aspect.</blockquote>
