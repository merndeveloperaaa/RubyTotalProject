<p>The old 15-minute blog video was getting really long in the tooth, so it&#8217;s with great pleasure that I can present <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/screencasts">the new video made with Rails 2.2</a> and done by Ryan Bates. It really takes it all up a notch by showing the creation of a blog with comments, ajax, feed, api, admin interface, and more.</p>
<p>Ryan Bates is also the author of the wonderful <a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts.com</a> site that features video explanations on Rails features. It&#8217;s a fantastic resource and now properly recognized on the screencasting page.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also linked up the commercial Rails screencasters. The amount of material available for people interested in learning by video is simply staggering.</p>
