<p>Stuart Halloway explains in numbers <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs/?p=92">how picking Rails over Java affects the bids</a> he puts in for consulting jobs. Since the actual programming is only one part of the bid, Rails naturally only has a chance to affect that part. But still, the approach that Stuart  takes in differentiating between the two is quite interesting.</p>
<p>For applications that Justin consider &#8220;within the sweet spot of Rails&#8221;, the bid will usually be 30-50% lower. For stuff outside that sweet spot, the bid will <i>still</i> be about 10% lower than the equivalent Java one.</p>
