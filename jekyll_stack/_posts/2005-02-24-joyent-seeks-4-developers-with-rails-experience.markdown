<p>David Young from the San Francisco start-up <a href="http://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a> are looking for 4 developers with Rails experience:</p>
<blockquote>We&#8217;re looking for four exceptional people, they should have deep experience writing good <span class="caps">GUI</span> applications and/or understand the integration of various open-source server products including mail, calendar, directory, samba, and rails. Some experience with Mozilla&#8217;s <span class="caps">XUL</span> is a big plus (it&#8217;s a bigger plus if they understand why <span class="caps">XUL</span> isn&#8217;t a complete solution). We will provide relocation (and visa, etc. sponsorship) assistance, but relocation is not necessary for the first phase. If desired, relocation would happen in the September, 2005 timeframe.</blockquote>
