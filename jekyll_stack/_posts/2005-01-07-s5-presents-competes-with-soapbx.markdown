<p>This is funny. With SoapBX <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/01/06/soapbx-presentations-powered-by-s5-textile-and-rails/">barely out the gates</a>, Lucas Carlson has already launched a competitor with <a href="http://www.s5presents.com/">S5 Presents</a> that does themes and is <a href="http://s5presents.com/s5presents-1.0.tgz" title="TGZ">open source</a>. He even claims to have done it in half the time of Pelle:</p>
<blockquote>S5 Presents was written in under 10 hours and 500 lines of code using the fantastic Ruby on Rails framework.</blockquote>
<p>So now you have two options for your online presentation needs. Cool stuff!</p>
