<p><a href="http://glu.ttono.us/">Kevin Clark</a> has written up <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/03/21/rails-for-designers">Rails for designers</a>, an intro to Rails directed at designers which focuses on the parts and concepts of the framework that are of most immediate relevance to a designer. The tutorial gets designers oriented and ready to find, edit and use an application&#8217;s templates. From layouts, to ERb, to partials and instance variables, this tutorial will get designers up and running in no time. If you are thinking of doing a Rails project, you could do a lot worse than having your designers start with this tutorial. Thanks for the primer Kevin.</p>
