<p>There&#8217;s a lot of action going on in the Rails <span class="caps">IDE</span> space these days. Besides <a href="http://www.radrails.org/">Aptana RadRails</a>, which has been around for a long time, Sun&#8217;s got impressive <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.info/wiki/view/RubyOnRails">Rails support in the new NetBeans</a>, and just this week <a href="http://www.codegear.com/products/3rdrail/">CodeGear launched their 3rdRail <span class="caps">IDE</span></a>, which also looks like a great setup.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m personally not quite ready to leave TextMate behind, but it&#8217;s encouraging to see all these options for dedicated Rails IDEs. It&#8217;s not going to be long before they&#8217;ll be giving regular text editors a serious run for their money.</p>
