<p><a href="http://ruby-talk.org/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/176161">Rake 0.7.0</a> has taken a great leap forward with the addition of parallel execution tasks and namespaces. Upcoming releases of Rails will surely use namespaces, so please do familiarize yourself with them today. And many thanks to Jim Weirich for his continued stellar work on this.</p>
