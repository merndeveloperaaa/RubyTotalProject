<p>I forgot to mention that a new and much improved version of <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> was made available a while back. The new version makes it a lot easier to install Rails with all of the dependencies thanks to the added <code>--include-dependencies</code> option and you can cleanup older versions of Rails with the new <code>cleanup</code> command.</p>
<p>The RubyGems team also started using Hieraki to do documentation. Checkout <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/">RubyGems Manuals</a>.</p>
