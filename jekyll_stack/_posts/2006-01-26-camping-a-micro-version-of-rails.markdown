<p>why the lucky stiff is at it again with his great stuff. This time he has produced a <a href="http://camping.rubyforge.org/">microframework called Camping</a> in the spirit and feel of Rails, but clocking in at just 4kb! Sure, it won&#8217;t do what most people need most of the time. But often, there&#8217;s good value in doing a bit of what a few people need occasionally. Camping, as the framework is called, fits that description to a T.</p>
<p>And since it conceptually lies close to Rails, you could easily start a quick thing in Camping and then not have too much trouble porting it to be a full-grown Rails application if need be. Camping even uses ActiveRecord to make it all that much easier.</p>
<p>Checkout the insane and <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html">too funny announcement</a> that even includes this classic description of <span class="caps">XML</span> sit-ups:</p>
