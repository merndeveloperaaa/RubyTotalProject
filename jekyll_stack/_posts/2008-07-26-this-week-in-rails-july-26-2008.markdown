<p>Welcome to the fourth edition of This Week in Rails, a weekly (and occasionally fortnightly) report with highlights from the Rails community.</p>
<p>David broke the news of the availability of <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/railseurope2008/public/schedule/grid">confirmed and scheduled talks at RailsConf Europe</a> which will be taking place this coming September. As you can see there will be a lot of exciting material this year, too.</p>
<p>The e-book <a href="http://www.nomedojogo.com/2008/07/21/free-book-ruby-on-rails-21-whats-new-7-translations/">Ruby on Rails 2.1 &#8211; What’s New</a> is now available in 7 languages: English, Portuguese, Japanese, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Italian and Korean. A Spanish version is coming as well. Olé!</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I took <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/07/14/a-close-look-at-three-rails-21-bugs/">a close look</a> at three Rails 2.1 database related bugs. On the same day, <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/2008/07/14/phusion-passenger-202-released/">Phusion Passenger 2.0.2 was released</a>. This edition backports a few bug fixes, including one for a small memory leak, and as such it&#8217;s highly recommended for anyone using Passenger 2 (aka mod_rails).</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.forumwarz.com/2008/7/20/kawaii-a-web-based-utility-like-script-console">Kawaii</a> is a web-based utility like script/console. The output of the inserted expression is visually appealing when compared to the one we&#8217;re used to in the shell. Speaking of shiny things, version 2 of the Open Flash Chart plugin was released. <a href="http://www.pullmonkey.com/projects/open_flash_chart">This page</a> shows a few wicked cool, professional looking charts (and their code) that can be generated with it.</p>
<p>The article <a href="http://locomotivation.com/2008/07/15/mulling-over-our-ruby-on-rails-full-text-search-options">Mulling Over Our Ruby On Rails Full Text Search Options</a> discusses a few possible options for performing full text searches in Rails applications. When it comes to Sphinx, there are then two prominent plugins: UltraSphinx and ThinkingSphinx. Rein Henrichs from Hashrocket, compares the two approaches in his post titled <a href="http://reinh.com/blog/2008/07/14/a-thinking-mans-sphinx.html">A Thinking Man&#8217;s Sphinx</a>.</p>
<p>The team behind <a href="http://rails-doc.org/">Rails-Doc.org</a> added a few more functionalities, including the ability to document the <span class="caps">API</span> for multiple versions of Rails.</p>
