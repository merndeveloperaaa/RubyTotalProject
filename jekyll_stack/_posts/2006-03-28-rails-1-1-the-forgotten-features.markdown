<p>Today, Mike Clark follows the release of Rails 1.1 with: <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2006/03/28#Rails11">Rails 1.1: The Forgotten Features</a>, a writeup of some of the <em>little</em> changes in Rails 1.1 that, though not big enough to make the big list of &quot;wow&quot;s, are sure to make all Rails developers&#8217; lives a little better every day.</p>
<p>Take a look and feel free to suggest additions to the list if you&#8217;ve got &#8217;em.</p>
