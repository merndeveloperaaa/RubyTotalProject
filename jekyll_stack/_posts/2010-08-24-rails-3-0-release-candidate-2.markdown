<p>The release candidate process is progressing as planned. This second candidate has very few changes over the first, which means that unless any blockers are discovered with this release, we&#8217;re targeting the final release of Rails 3.0 for this week(!!!).</p>
<p>So please do help us weed out any blockers. Especially in our two new main dependencies: <a href="http://gembundler.com/v1.0/index.html">Bundler</a> and <a href="http://github.com/rails/arel">ARel</a>. They&#8217;ve both progressed into release candidacy for their 1.0 releases and will be sharing the same 1.0-final release date as Rails 3.0.</p>
<p>You can see a complete list of all the dotted t&#8217;s and crossed i&#8217;s on the new fabulous Github <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.0_RC...v3.0.0_RC2">comparo view of RC1 and RC2</a>.</p>
<p>As always, you install this latest version with: <code>gem install rails --pre</code></p>
<p>Also note that Rails 3.0 now has it&#8217;s own <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/3-0-stable">stable branch</a>. The <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails">master branch</a> is now reserved for Rails 3.1 development. (That&#8217;s right, we&#8217;re already going there and it&#8217;s going to be M-A-G-I-C-A-L!).</p>
