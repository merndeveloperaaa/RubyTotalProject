<p>In <a href="http://www.carpeaqua.com/archives/2004/12/23/2004_computing_in_review.php">2004 Computing In Review</a>, Justin Williams proclaims Ruby on Rails to be his Technology of the Year #1:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Without a doubt, the most fun I have had programming in the past few months has been with Ruby on Rails. While the majority of my year was dominated with Cocoa stuff at work, I have been working almost exclusively in Rails for the past few.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>As #2, Justin likes TypeKey for cutting his comment spams from 30/day to zero, and as #3 enters <span class="caps">RSS</span>.</p>
