<p><img src="http://storetn.cafepress.com/3/25707913_F_store.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px">Bill Katz has setup a <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/rails_stuff">Cafepress shop for Rails swag and wear</a> that features our wavy railroad tracks on the back and a discrete Ruby on Rails wording on the front. There&#8217;s currently no markup over the standard Cafepress prices, so you can get your Rails <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/rails_stuff.25707895">thong</a> or <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/rails_stuff.25707892">baby bip</a> at a pretty descent cost.</p>
<p>This is all just in time for <span class="caps">OSCON</span>, so all you Railers can show up representin&#8217; tha posse, yo!</p>
