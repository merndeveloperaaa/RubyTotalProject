<p>We&#8217;ve had a lot of <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/08/22/jason-hunter-explains-java-s-dilemma">discussions of Rails as a disruptive technology</a>, but now David Geary is focusing on <a href="http://jroller.com/page/dgeary?entry=tipping_rails">explaining the growth</a> (and imminent growth) through the lens of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316346624/qid=1125523477/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0184563-9068667?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Gladwell&#8217;s tipping point</a>. Geary believes that Rails is standing right in front of the tipping point or perhaps even on it already:</p>
<blockquote>In the end, of course, this blog entry is simply my musing. Will Rails hit a tipping point and become widely adopted in the near future? I am certain of it; in fact, I think the tipping has already begun. But, of course, only time will tell. In the meantime, I continue to have a blast every day trying out new things in Rails and figuring out the best way to show my future readers how to do them too.</blockquote>
