<p><img src="http://www.themidnightcoders.com/images/newindex/blue_rails.jpg" align="right" border="0" />Jon Shumate introduces <a href="http://www.themidnightcoders.com/weborb/rubyonrails/index.htm">WebORB</a>:</p>
<blockquote><i>WebORB for Rails is server-side technology enabling connectivity between Flex and Flash Remoting clients and Ruby on Rails applications. WebORB for Rails can be installed as a plugin into any Rails application to expose Ruby classes as remote services. The product provides a complete implementation of the Adobe&#8217;s AMF0 and AMF3 messaging protocols and thus supports any Flash Remoting or Flex client.</i></blockquote>
