<p>Multi-view development is a big deal in Rails 2.0. We&#8217;ve made it much simpler to allow the same action to serve many different formats. From <span class="caps">HTML</span> to <span class="caps">XML</span> to <span class="caps">JSON</span> to <span class="caps">RSS</span> and <span class="caps">ATOM</span> to <span class="caps">CSV</span> to whatever.</p>
<p>But did you know that you can use the same multi-view system to trout out different flavors of the same basic types? Say, give iPhone users a custom <span class="caps">HTML</span> interface while serving regular <span class="caps">HTML</span> users with the standard feast.</p>
<p>Slash Dot Dash teaches you how to do exactly that: <a href="http://www.slashdotdash.net/articles/2007/12/04/iphone-on-rails-creating-an-iphone-optimised-version-of-your-rails-site-using-iui-and-rails-2">Give a Rails 2.0 application an iPhone UI</a>.</p>
