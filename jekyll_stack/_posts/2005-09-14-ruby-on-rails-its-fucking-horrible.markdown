<p>This is a rare treat. Someone who actually gave Rails a good couple of hours, but couldn&#8217;t get anything done, and thus <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/levez/354334.html">hates its guts</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Well, I&#8217;ve found this: it&#8217;s fucking horrible. Anyone who tries to convince you that it&#8217;s in some way an elegant and consistent way to create &#8216;web applications&#8217; is entirely insane. It&#8217;s taking me hours and hours just to get the most basic of stuff done, and a lot of that time was spent wrestling with the hideous documentation and bizarre, frustrating syntax.</blockquote>
<p>Now get this. Since he was unable to get something done quickly (too steep a learning curve), the poor chap wants to give Python and Zope a swing ;). Not an evil word about either, but the learning curve of the latter is not exactly known to be flat. Heh.</p>
<p>This thought on &#8220;pre-written code&#8221; is also pretty funny:</p>
<blockquote>If you really must use lots of pre-written code (and hey, sometimes that is handy &#8212; a <span class="caps">DBMS</span>-agnostic interface, say) then get to grips with Pear for <span class="caps">PHP</span>.</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s actually both a testament to <span class="caps">PHP</span> (you can get something done without using any external frameworks or libraries at all), but also an interesting reflection about a fair share of <span class="caps">PHP</span> programmers work (they don&#8217;t use or like &#8220;pre-written code&#8221;).</p>
<p>In any case, he&#8217;s frustrations were real. It would be nice to hear about them in specific so we can do something about it. Although, it does bring a smile to read &#8220;it&#8217;s fucking horrible&#8221;. It seems like we&#8217;ve made it all the way around the programmer spectrum with that.</p>
