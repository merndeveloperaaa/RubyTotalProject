<p>Amy Hoy is a <a href="http://www.infocookie.com/welcome/">designer, programmer, and writer</a> digging into Rails. She read Curt Hibbs&#8217; great introduction article on Rails at O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s OnLAMP, but decided she&#8217;d like to decorate it a bit with why&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote>The only thing is, like all tutorials, it doesn&#8217;t always explain why. Why is that the syntax? What does that line mean, exactly? Why is the application designed so it fits together that way? Me, I like to know why&mdash;in reality, because of my designer brain, I have to know why to really grok it and retain it.</blockquote>
<p>That decoration turned into a whole article entilted <a href="http://www.slash7.com/flashback/2005/01/oreilly_onlamp.html">Really Getting Started in Rails</a> that works very well as a companion to Hibbs&#8217; original article. Great work, Amy!</p>
