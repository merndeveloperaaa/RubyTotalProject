<p>The <a href="http://beta.peacelibrary.org/">Peace Library</a> is an online index of Conflict Transformation &amp; Peacebuilding information featuring research papers, reports, and news related to the Sri Lanka peace process put together by the non-profit web media company <a href="http://www.info-share.org/">InfoShare</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in &#8220;beta&#8221; but already features <a href="http://beta.peacelibrary.org/publications/list">207 publications</a> wrapped in an attractive interface. Read more about them <a href="http://beta.peacelibrary.org/publications/about">here</a>.</p>
<p>Yet another nice app riding the Rails.</p>
