<p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> is an institution in web design. I&#8217;ve learned more than a few tricks over the years from this venerable magazine and its therefore with great honor that I see the newly <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/ala40">relaunched version 4.0</a> is a Ruby on Rails application. Congratulation to Dan Benjamin, Zeldman, Erin Kissane, and the rest of the team behind <span class="caps">ALA</span>.</p>
