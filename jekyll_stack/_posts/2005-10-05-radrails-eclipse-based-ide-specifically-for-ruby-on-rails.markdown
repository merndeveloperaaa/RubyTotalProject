<p>Since not everyone has yet switched to a Mac and can enjoy the benefits of <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, we need people working on better editor and <span class="caps">IDE</span> support for other platforms. <a href="http://www.radrails.org/">RadRails</a> is a project to build a cross-platform <span class="caps">IDE</span> for Ruby on Rails using the Eclipse platform. It&#8217;s still very early days, but they have an alpha out you can play with. And there&#8217;s a lot of activity around the project. Sounds promising indeed.</p>
