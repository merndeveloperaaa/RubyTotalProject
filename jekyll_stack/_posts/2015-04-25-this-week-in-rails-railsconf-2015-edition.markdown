ZOMG! Hello everyone, it is [Godfrey](https://twitter.com/chancancode) here (it's been a while!), delivering the latest news from Rails to your inbox. This happens to be [RailsConf](http://railsconf.com) week, so we have lots to cover; lets get to it!

Note: The links to the RailsConf videos are the unedited live-stream versions, and they might be removed later. Also, only talks from the keynote room are available at the moment, but don't worry â€“ the full set of talks will eventually be made available to everyone. Follow [@railsconf](https://twitter.com/railsconf) to stay in the loop!

## Rails Conf 2015

### [Day 1: DHH keynote, Sara Chipps keynote](https://youtu.be/oMlX9i9Icno)

[David Heinemeier Hansson](https://twitter.com/dhh) kicked off the conference by announcing a few new features in Rails 5: Rails API, turbolinks 3, a native mobile wrapper and web sockets support (a.k.a. Action Cable).

The amazing [Sara Chipps](https://twitter.com/sarajchipps) wrapped up the day by sharing her experience [teaching kids to code](http://www.jewelbots.com).

Check the [schedule](http://railsconf.com/schedule) for a full list of talks from Room 202. Shameless plug: [yours truly](https://twitter.com/chancancode) gave a talk following the DHH keynote ;)

### [Day 2: Aaron Patterson keynote, lightning talks](https://youtu.be/wQCda5PBn0A)

[Aaron Patterson](https://twitter.com/tenderlove) started the second day with a punishing amount of word play jokes. In between trolling other keynote speakers and rebooting his computer, he also dropped an incredible amount of performance knowledge.

Don't forget to catch the lightning talks towards the end of the stream!

### [Day 3: Ruby heroes, core team panel, Kent Beck closing keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdWMcs9EEOE)

The [Ruby heroes](http://rubyheroes.com) awards were given on the third day, followed by a panel discussion featuring some members from the [Rails core team](https://rubyonrails.org/core).

[Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/kentbeck), aka the creator of [XP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) (not to be confused with [the other XP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP)) wrapped up the conference with a focus on the human elements of programming.

## Featured

### [This week's Rails contributors](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20150418-20150424)

Just because it is Rails Conf, it doesn't mean contributions to the Rails codebase will see any slow down. In fact, 37 contributors made their mark on Rails this week, with _11 first-time contributors_!

### [Rails API](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19832)

As mentioned in David's keynote, Rails API will be part of Rails 5. Follow the pull request to track the progress and chime in on the discussion. (Please avoid leaving +1 comments!)

## New Stuff

### [Generic bug report template](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19818)

Joining the [existing bug report templates](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/guides/bug_report_templates), this new template will be handy for reproducing small bugs with a minimal setup. Check the [contributing guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#create-an-executable-test-case) for details.

### [[attr\_name]\_previously\_changed?](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19847)

With this patch, you can easily check if a single attribute has previously changed and react to those changes appropriately.

## That's a wrap

It's been quite a week! We didn't have room to cover everything that happened in [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/commits/master), so head over and take a look for yourself.

Thank you for your continued support for the newsletter. (I am very glad to have met a few of you at RailsConf!) As always, feel free to [share this with your friends](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com). If you have any comments or would like to help, [drop me a line](mailto:godfrey@brewhouse.io)!
