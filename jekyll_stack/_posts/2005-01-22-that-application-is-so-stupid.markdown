<p>Just as Patrick Lightbody <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000399.html#comments">recants</a> his <a href="http://www.lightbody.net/~plightbo/archives/000144.html">ill-guided charge</a>, Geert Bevin &mdash; also involved with a Java web-framework, this time <a href="https://rife.dev.java.net/"><span class="caps">RIFE</span></a> &mdash; picks up the torch and tries his best to <a href="http://www.uwyn.com/blog/archives/000108.html">scorch the earth</a> anew:</p>
<blockquote><i>About tadalist, that application is so stupid that I&#8217;m wondering how the hell it could have taken him 600 lines to write it. Also, the hugely hiped &#8216;killer application&#8217; of RoR, Basecamp, is a total fraud imho. The screenshots look nice, and are nicely presented. So I did make an account and started using it. And honestly, everything they say is true, it sets itself apart in simplicity. Not difficult to write that in a few weeks.</i></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s incredible how much vile bile that lies within the Java community. I&#8217;m beginning to understand why many of the defectors I&#8217;ve talked to are so happy about the Ruby and Rails communities. Oh well, back to the stupid, fraud applications.</p>
