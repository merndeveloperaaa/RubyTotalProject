<p>A List A Part is featuring a special issue dedicated to Ruby on Rails. There&#8217;s <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/creatingmoreusinglesseffortwithrubyonrails">Creating More Using Less Effort with Ruby on Rails</a> by Michael Slater and <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/gettingstartedwithrubyonrails">Getting Started with Ruby on Rails</a> by Dan Benjamin. Both articles serve as great introduction to what all the hoopla is about. Great stuff to forward to friends who might be interested, but still haven&#8217;t made the jump.</p>
