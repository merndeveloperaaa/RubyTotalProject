<p><a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com">Working With Rails</a> is an attempt to index all the developers around the world working with Rails. It offers a few ways to browse the index and while the authority and popularity lists are perhaps a tad silly, I love looking at the <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/browse/country">country list</a>. 3 programmers in Peru, 1 in Kazakhstan, and 3 in Uzbekistan. How cool is that?</p>
