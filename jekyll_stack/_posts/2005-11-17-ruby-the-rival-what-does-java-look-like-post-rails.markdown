<p>O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s ONJava.com had <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/11/16/ruby-the-rival.html?page=1">a chat with four prominent Java developers</a> under the title of &#8220;Ruby the Rival&#8221;. Half of them has switched a big chunk of their development to Rails.</p>
<p>James Duncan Davidson notes about the maintainability of Rails applications and the size of the apps that can be built with it:</p>
<blockquote>Can a team write a Ruby on Rails app that performs a large number of features, does it well, and is maintainable over time? Yes. No question. After working with Ruby on Rails for a while, I would be confident tackling any size web application problem with it. But, that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve spent some time with it and now have seen that it&#8217;s possible to write a well-designed application.</blockquote>
<p>Bruce Tate on what increased productivity means for organizations:</p>
<blockquote>What if the productivity numbers are real? What if you really can get a 5x boost? Then, you can do the work of divisions with a department, and the work of departments with a team of two.</blockquote>
