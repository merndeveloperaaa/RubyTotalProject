<p>On the Apple Developer site, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/opensourcescripting.html">new article about open-source scripting languages</a> and how you can use Xcode to work with them. On Ruby, they note:</p>
<blockquote> Ruby is gaining popularity as a language to write web-based applications. Ruby scripts can easily be executed with <span class="caps">CGI</span>, and Ruby contains a class called <span class="caps">CGI</span> that is used specifically for creating <span class="caps">CGI</span> scripts. The <span class="caps">CGI</span> class has methods for generating <span class="caps">HTML</span> and dealing with cookies, among many other capabilities. If you are considering using Ruby to write web-based applications, you won&#8217;t want to miss the Ruby on Rails project. Rails is an open source web programming framework that is rapidly gaining mindshare due to its simplicity and clean design.</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
