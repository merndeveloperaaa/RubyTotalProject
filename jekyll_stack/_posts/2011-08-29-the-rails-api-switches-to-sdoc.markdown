The Ruby on Rails API is switching to [SDoc](https://github.com/voloko/sdoc) starting with 3.1.

SDoc is a RDoc format created by Володя Колесников ([@voloko](https://twitter.com/#!/voloko)) that has been powering [railsapi.com](http://railsapi.com) for a long time.

Among other things, SDoc provides a search box with fuzzy match completion, tree browsing, keyboard navigation, and a really nice template.

You can already see the upgrade in the [edge API](http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org).

We'd like to thank very much Володя for his work updating SDoc for the official API. Thanks man!
