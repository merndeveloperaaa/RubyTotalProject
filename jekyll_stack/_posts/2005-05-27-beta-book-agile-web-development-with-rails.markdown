<p>The first Rails book is out &#8212; in beta. <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> is not scheduled to hit hardcopy before early August, but people need the information now. What to do? Let people have a peak into the kitchen and get a taste of the messy reality of pre-editing. So if you can live with spelling mistakes, bad page numbering, and possibly technical errors, you can have a taste at the master tome of the first wave of Rails books.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more than 500 pages of tutorial and reference on the Rails framework. We build a complete e-commerce application and go through all the sub-frameworks of Rails. There&#8217;s even a good 30-paged chapter on how to take your application online. Which web server to pick, how to install FastCGI, and all that jazz.</p>
<p>Buy the beta book now and you get the final polished copy &#8220;for free&#8221;. We&#8217;d be double happy if you <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/shopsite_sc/shopping_cart/order.cgi?storeid=*1aa5c810f1b4818814b37c0f6a3aed&amp;sbid=SSMSB1117195469.3418450&amp;prevlocation=http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/">bought the combo-pack</a>, which also includes the final hardcopy book &#8212; but doesn&#8217;t hand all the cash to distributors and Amazon.</p>
<p>The Pragmatic Bookshelf has a lot more Rails books lurking under the surface. The success of this first title will be a good indicator for how many gets the &#8220;go&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure other publishers are watching this thing closely too in order to determine their involvement. So let&#8217;s make this the home run title that grows the market above and beyond.</p>
