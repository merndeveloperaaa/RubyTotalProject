<p>Due to the overwhelming success of selling 400 seats in just a week, RailsConf has been able to extend the venue and open up an <a href="http://railsconf.org/articles/2006/02/14/expanded-venue-registration-re-open">additional 150 seats</a>. So if you missed out during the first round of registrations, now would be a very good time to expedite that intention to be there and <a href="http://www.railsconf.org/pages/registration">sign up</a>. Hope to see you in Chicago in June!</p>
<p><b><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</b> Away they went! The additional 150 seats have been sold in a little less than 24 hours and we&#8217;re thus full. We&#8217;re going to have one hell of a time with 550 Railers in the room. Awesome!</p>
