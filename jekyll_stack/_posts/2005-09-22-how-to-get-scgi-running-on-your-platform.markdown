<p>Zed is trucking away on <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/projects/scgi_rails/">the Rails <span class="caps">SCGI</span> runner</a> and its rapidly improving. The latest release 0.3.1 includes a bunch of documentation on how to get going on your platform. Whether its Windows or &#8217;nix, Apache 2 or 1.3, or lighttpd, or what have you. Please give Zed some good support in his effort to dethrone <span class="caps">FCGI</span>.</p>
