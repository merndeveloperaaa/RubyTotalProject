<p>Joe Agliozzo  is looking to hire a Rails developer for a freelance project to work on an application that will &#8220;&#8230;allow users to post local restaurants, shops, attractions etc. to the database along with reviews and &#8216;star&#8217; ratings. Comments and additions to the posts by users will also be allowed.&#8221; Sounds like a fun community project.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what he&#8217;s looking for in a developer:</p>
<blockquote>The developer hired wll be provided with wire frame layouts of all pages, and a feature set summary will also be provided. Architecture of the db and programming is left to the discretion of the programmer. There will be as little &#8220;reinventing the wheel&#8221; as possible. I intend to use industry standard interfaces, etc.. such as Amazon.com uses in posting book reviews. Please include at least one example of similar site you have done in Ruby already.</blockquote>
