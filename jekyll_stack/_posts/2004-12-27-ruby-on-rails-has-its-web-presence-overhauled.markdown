<p>Welcome to the bling-spanking new web presence for Ruby on Rails. We&#8217;ve gathered all the fledging properties under one design and bound them all in slickness. In the same breath, we&#8217;re restoring the lands of <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">Loud Thinking</a> to more of a personal weblog for David Heinemeier Hansson and assigning the responsibility of lavish Rails praise and tracking to this entity.</p>
<p>Until we&#8217;ve had some time to move it all around properly, the <span class="caps">SVN</span> repository remains at http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails while the rest of the site has home at .com. We&#8217;ll get it all sorted out eventually.</p>
