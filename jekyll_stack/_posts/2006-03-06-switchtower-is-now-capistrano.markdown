<p>We were served with a &#8220;cease and desist&#8221; from Raindance Communications, Inc. over the use of their registered trademark <span class="caps">SWITCHTOWER</span> on Friday. This led to a wild three-day brainstorming session and a new name for SwitchTower: <em>Capistrano</em>.</p>
<p>New gems and so forth will be available tomorrow, as well as updated documentation using the new name. For existing SwitchTower users, you&#8217;ll need to run <code>cap -A .</code> on each of your projects, once the new gems are available and installed. (<code>cap</code> is the new name of the <code>switchtower</code> utility.)</p>
<p>You can read all about the brainstorming process and how the new name was selected <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2006/03/06/switchtower-renamed">on Jamis&#8217; blog</a>.</p>
