<p>Eric Mill went ahead and created <a href="http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2007/4/2/jester-javascriptian-rest">Jester</a>, a library that lets you manipulate your Rails-style resources with javascript models.  I think it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re seeing implementations in other languages.  This <a href="http://routes.groovie.org/index.html">python port of Routes</a> implements map.resources, can a python port of ActiveResource be far behind?</p>
