It&#8217;s web-based group chat for business where file transfers work reliably and where you have shared access to the logs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also dripping with delicious Ajax, courtesy of Prototype maestro Sam Stephenson, who joined 37signals in December along with Marcel Molina. So go check it out. More details about the launch on <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000563.html">Loud Thinking</a> and <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/launch_campfire_easy_group_chat_for_business.php?194#comments">37signals</a>.</p>
