<p>We have been advised of several vulnerabilities in the <a href="http://github.com/rails/in_place_editing/tree/master">in_place_editing plugin</a> which was created prior to the 2.0.0 release of Ruby on Rails.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The actions generated by in_place_edit_for perform no verification of the request method, allowing a hostile website to bypass built in <span class="caps">CSRF</span> protection.</li>
	<li>The the input controls generated by in_place_editor_field perform no output sanitization, leaving the application vulnerable to <span class="caps">XSS</span> attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users of all versions of the plugin are advised to update to the latest version contained in our git repository at:</p>
<p><ins>git://github.com/rails/in_place_editing.git</ins></p>
<p>For users who are unable to use git, we have provided <a href="/assets/2009/2/28/in_place_editing.zip">a zip file containing the patched code</a>.  The <a href="/assets/2009/2/28/0001-Security-fixes-for-XSS-and-CSRF-issues.patch">patch containing the fix</a> is available also.</p>
<p>Users of all versions of Rails prior to 2.0 are advised to stop using the in_place_editing functionality, or manually apply those changes to their version of Rails.  If these changes are backported, this post will be updated to include a patch for the relevant versions of rails.</p>
<p>Thanks to Pawel Stradomski of <a href="http://www.codesprinters.com/">Code Sprinters</a> for reporting this bug to us and working so patiently with us to get it resolved.</p>
