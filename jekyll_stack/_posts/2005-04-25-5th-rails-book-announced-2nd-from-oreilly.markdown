<p>Robby Russell has <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2005/04/25/i-am-writing-a-ruby-on-rails-book">announced his authorship</a> of an upcoming book that&#8217;ll provide &#8220;&#8230; an in-depth look at RoR, how it works inside and out&#8221;. The book is to be published by O&#8217;Reilly. This will then be their second Rails book (<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/03/22/4th-book-coming-rails-developer-notebook/">they&#8217;re already doing a Developer&#8217;s Notebook</a>) and the fifth book in total announced for Rails. What awesome news!</p>
<p>Hopefully we can get a nice mesh of complimentary books out of all these announcements. We&#8217;ll want the imminent sea of uptake to acquire the entire shelve of Rails book at the book store. Not worry about choosing.</p>
