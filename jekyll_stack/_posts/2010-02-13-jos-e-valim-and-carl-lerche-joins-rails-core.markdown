<p>Please give a warm welcome to José Valim and Carl Lerche as they both join <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/core">the Rails core team</a>. Both guys have been key contributors to the Rails 3 development and both have made it into <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/">the top 10 of all-time Rails contributors</a>. It&#8217;s an honor to have them on the team!</p>
