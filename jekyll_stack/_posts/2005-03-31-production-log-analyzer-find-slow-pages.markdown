<p>Eric Hodel has released the Production Log Analyzer:</p>
<blockquote>The Production Analyzer lets you find out which pages on your site are dragging you down. pl_analyze requires the use of SyslogLogger (included) because the default Logger doesn&#8217;t give any way to associate lines logged to a request.</blockquote>
<p>Hodel and crew used this to locate slow running pages in <a href="http://www.43things.com">43 Things</a>. You can learn more at at <a href="http://rails-analyzer.rubyforge.org/"><span class="caps">PLA</span> site</a>.</p>
