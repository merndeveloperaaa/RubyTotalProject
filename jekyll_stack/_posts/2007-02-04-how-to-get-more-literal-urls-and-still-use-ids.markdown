<p>Obie <a href="http://jroller.com/page/obie?entry=seo_optimization_of_urls_in">walks through the technique</a> for getting more search engine-friendly URLs and still retain the ease of use with auto-incrementing ids.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same technique we used on the new 37signals blog engine to get urls like <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/247-calling-all-basecamp-customers-in-nyc-or-chicago">http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/247-calling-all-basecamp-customers-in-nyc-or-chicago</a>.</p>
<p>The 247 is what Rails see and calling-all-basecamp-customers-in-nyc-or-chicago is what Google will focus on. Have your cake and eat it too!</p>
