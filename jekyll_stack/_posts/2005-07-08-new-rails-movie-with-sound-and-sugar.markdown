<p>The <a href="http://media.nextangle.com/rails/rails_setup.mov">original Rails movie</a> left jaws hanging and had developers all over the world stepping through it in slow motion to take it all in. But that was then. Rails 0.5 looks almost primitive from the eyes of a developer working with Rails 0.13. It was high time to rectify both that, the lack of narration, and the notion that Rails is all about Scaffolding.</p>
<p>So allow me to present: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/media/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov">The New Rails Movie!</a> It&#8217;s 50% longer, but shows at least 150% more. And you get my enthusiastic whoops! speak from the Brazilian <span class="caps">FISL</span> 6.0 conference where the movie premiered:</p>

<p>Many thanks to Pablo for providing me with the sound from the conference and many thanks to Audacity for making it something you could listen to.</p>
