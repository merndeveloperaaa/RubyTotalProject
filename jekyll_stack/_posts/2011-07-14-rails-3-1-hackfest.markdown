Have you ever wanted to contribute back to Rails? This is the opportunity you've been looking for. We're organizing a Rails 3.1 Hackfest on the weekend of July 23rd and 24th!!!

GOAL
----
The goal of this event is to have Rails 3.1 as the most stable version as possible. So, in this event we will focus on working on `3-1-stable` branch of the project.

HOW
----
In order to achieve this we encourage you to:

* Upgrade your existing apps to Rails 3.1 and report any existing issue if it doesn't already exist
* Test your favorite plugins/gems with Rails 3.1 and report any existing issue if it doesn't already exist
* Review all the [open issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/rails/rails/pulls)
  - Check if issues can be reproduced
  - If so provide as many details as possible (for example it's important for us to know which Rails version/s are affected. They could be 2-3-stable, 3-0-stable, 3-1-stable or master)
  - If it's not possible to reproduce the issue, add a comment on github issue tracker indicating that
* Provide test cases and patches for 3-1-stable blockers only (blockers will be tagged as 'blocker')
  - Follow  the [contributing to Ruby on Rails guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html)
  - Try to provide a failing test case (if you can't figure out the whole solution)
  - Try to provide a full patch (tests, code and docs if needed)
* Write documentation (guides, API), you can push modifications directly to [docrails](http://github.com/lifo/docrails)
* Write blog posts about your experience using 3.1

Please note that since we are on the release candidate already, only patches for blocking issues will be accepted.

WHO
---
From the core team: Aaron Patterson (tenderlove), Xavier Noria (fxn) and Santiago Pastorino (spastorino), and the core contributors: Damien Mathieu (dmathieu), Prem Sichanugrist (sikachu) and Josh Kalderimis (joshk) will be around, so don't hesitate to ask whatever questions you may have.
