<p>We all know that for some time this blog has needed some love. Well at last it can be told: There&#8217;s been a super-secret project underway for a while to upgrade the blog and get it running the way it should. We didn&#8217;t want to make a huge deal of it, but it seems that a few overly enthusiastic readers <em>really</em> enjoy posting bug reports as comments. So just chill out &#8211; the upgrade is coming soon. Posting thousands of comments isn&#8217;t going to make it happen any faster.</p>
