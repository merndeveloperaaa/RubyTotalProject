<p><a href="http://www.foopad.com/">Foopad.com</a> is a simple, hosted wiki done by <a href="http://bennolan.com/">Ben Nolan</a> (the guy behind <a href="http://bennolan.com/behaviour/">Behavior</a>) using Ruby on Rails. It&#8217;s still early days and the <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span>-editing seems to choke Safari, but do take it for a spin. It&#8217;s free, so how can you argue with that?</p>
