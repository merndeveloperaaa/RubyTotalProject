<p><img src="http://blogs.pragprog.com/images/pragdave/rails2.jpg" height="242" width="203" border="0" style="margin-left: 10px" align="right" /> It&#8217;s back. Agile Web Development with Rails is now available in a 50%-done beta version of its second edition. Pretty much everything is getting a major overhaul. All the cool stuff we&#8217;ve added in Rails 1.1 is covered in the same structure that people so liked from the first version.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s wonderful to be able to present a version two of the primary title that has helped so many people get into Rails. And through the wonders of PDFs and agile publishing, to have it available so soon.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re interested in getting the latest scoop on everything from <span class="caps">RJS</span>, to join models, to migrations, to RESTful interfaces, to Capistrano, this is most definitely the book to get.</p>
<p>P.S.: Just so you don&#8217;t feel buyers remorse two days after getting a <span class="caps">PDF</span> of the first edition, anyone that bought that <span class="caps">PDF</span> on or after April 1st gets a free upgrade to the second edition.</p>
