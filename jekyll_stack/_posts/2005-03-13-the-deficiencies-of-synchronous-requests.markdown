<p>Jamis Buck has a <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/blog.cgi/programming/To%20sync%20or%20not%20to%20sync_20050312130639.tx">good examination of the problems inhibiting the use of synchronous requests</a> in the Ajax world. Synchronous is a much easier programatically model, have worked well for Ta-da List, but certainly not without its flaws. Good debate.</p>
