<p>Jaikoo is <a href="http://blog.jaikoo.com/index.php/2005/07/17/thats-kind-of-cool/54/">longing to feel like a man again</a>. And nothing like doing long hours debugging impossible JavaScript has that feel of a hard day&#8217;s work:</p>
<blockquote>In fact its so easy I feel totally un-masculine right now. Dag nammit, where are the hours wrestling with JavaScript in venkmann? Where&rsquo;s the fun without the pain? I mean the real pain!!! <span class="caps">GRRR</span>!!! Come on Rails!! Make me feel like a man again!!! Stop making it so easy for gawd sakes, throw some <span class="caps">XML</span> in there or something, make it more cryptic;). So this is me, feeling like a total girly boy right now, signing off from the frilly land of Rails. <strong>starts manicuring nails</strong></blockquote>
<p>Make it as easy as not to.</p>
