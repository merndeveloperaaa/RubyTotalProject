<p>One of the more exciting new community features in Rails 0.14 is the plugin system. It drastically lowers the barrier for people that wants to distribute their changes to the framework and for those that want to use said changes. But we haven&#8217;t yet arrived at a conclusion on how to track and aggregate these plugins, so far now the good ol&#8217; wiki will do. Checkout the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Plugins">Plugins page on the Rails wiki</a>.</p>
