<p><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/">RailsConf 2009</a> is drawing ever closer and it&#8217;s going to be one hell of a show worthy of Vegas glitz and glamour. To let you all get more familiar with who&#8217;s going to be talking and what they&#8217;ll be talking about, Chad Fowler has been doing a series of presenter interviews:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://chadfowler.com/2009/3/19/railsconf-speaker-interview-michael-bleigh">Michael Bleigh from Present.ly on Twitter apps with Rails</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://chadfowler.com/2009/3/16/railsconf-speaker-interview-obie-fernandez">Obie Fernandez from Hashrocket on Rails entrepreneurs</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://chadfowler.com/2009/3/10/railsconf-speaker-interview-charlie-nutter-and-evan-phoenix">Charlie Nutter and Evan Phoenix on alternative Ruby implementations</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, <a href="http://blog.zerosum.org/2009/3/1/rumble-panel-at-railsconf">Nicke Plante is talking about his Rumble Panel</a> and <a href="http://www.martyandrews.net/blog/2009/03/im_speaking_at_railsconf_2009.html">Marty Andrews about his automated code quality check talk</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also announced some of the keynoters. In addition to yours truly, we&#8217;ll have Bob Martin of ObjectMentor, Chris Wanstrath of Github, and Timothy Ferris of 4-hour work week and lifestyle designs rock it out. We&#8217;re also going to have a Rails Core panel of some sort.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be a great time. You can follow along with even more announcements from the conference on Twitter by subscribing to <a href="http://twitter.com/railsconf">@railsconf</a>. See you in Vegas? Of course I will!</p>
