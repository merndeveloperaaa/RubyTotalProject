<p><a href="http://www.backpackit.com">Backpack</a> is the third application from <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a> that&#8217;s now available online. Just like <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> came birth to Rails itself, <a href="http://www.tadalist.com">Ta-da</a> drove great features like caching, Backpack has been the main driver for a lot of interesting developments in Rails. Most visibly is the incredibly strong support for Ajax interfaces that Rails now sports.</p>
<p>The innerHTML approach with server-side fragment rendering was developed specifically for Backpack and has now been extracted for general use in Rails. It&#8217;s joyful to see that the Ajax integration in Rails has caught the interest of so many developers and 37signals is especially thankful for the work of people like <a href="http://conio.net/">Sam Stephenson</a>, <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/">Thomas Fuchs</a>, <a href="http://sean.treadway.info/">Sean Treadway</a>, and others.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks, we&#8217;ll be taking advantage of even more of the Ajax innovation happening in Rails, such as the <a href="http://sean.treadway.info/demo/upload">upload progress indicator</a> and the Google Suggest-style searching. In the meanwhile, do checkout Backpack as the currently best example of the wonders of Ajax in Rails.</p>
