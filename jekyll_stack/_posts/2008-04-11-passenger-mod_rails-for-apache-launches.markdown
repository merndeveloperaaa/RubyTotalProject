<p>The guys at Phusion has finally wrapped up <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a>, their mod_rails-like module for Apache. It&#8217;s looking like a great, easy solution for people who want a more <span class="caps">PHP</span>-like deployment story. Just dump your files in a directory setup with a vhost and off you go. Touch tmp/restart.txt and the application is restarted. Doesn&#8217;t get much simpler than that.</p>
