<p>Let me tell you where you&#8217;re going to be on October 14th through 16th. You&#8217;re going to be in San Diego, California. That&#8217;s right. RubyConf just opened the doors for the <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/prereg/dispatch.cgi?controller=main&amp;action=index">preregistration</a> (which incidentally is a Rails app by David Black) and I managed to grab the entry with ID = 1 in the database. So you know I&#8217;m going to be there. Are you?</p>
