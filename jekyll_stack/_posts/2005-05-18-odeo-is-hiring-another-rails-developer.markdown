<p>I didn&#8217;t line them all up for this, I swear. But Rails positions are just emerging from everywhere. Today its the imminent podcasting venture know as Odeo that&#8217;s looking for another teammate:</p>
<blockquote>Our main application uses Ruby on Rails, so either experience with that or the ability to learn quickly is required. However, more important requirements include: Extensive experience developing web applications, especially the back-end of high-scalability, consumer-oriented sites. Interest in joining a risky, by-the-seat-of-the-pants startup with minimal bennies, in exchange for tons of impact, minimal bureaucracy, and some decent upside potential.</blockquote>
