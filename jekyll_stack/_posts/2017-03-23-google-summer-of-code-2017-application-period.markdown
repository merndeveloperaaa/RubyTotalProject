Want to participate in this year's [Google Summer of Code][gsoc]? Great! The
student application period is now open. Be swift, though, as it ends on the 3rd
of April.

If you are interested, you can check out the [Google Summer of Code
FAQ][gsoc-faq] or hit us up on the [mailing list][mailing-list] if you have any
questions.

To apply, head on to the [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] website and write us a
proposal. You can check out our existing list of [ideas], but feel free to
pitch one of your own as well. What is a good proposal you may ask? You can see
a bunch of accepted proposals on our [Google Summer of Code wiki][wiki].

Good luck! ✌️
