<p><img src="http://www.loudthinking.com/lt-files/textmate_icon.png" width="132" height="144" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px" /><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> is the editor powering the work of every single <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/core">core contributor</a> and now the best just got even better. The <a href="http://macromates.com/blog/archives/2006/01/06/textmate-15/">1.5 release</a> of TextMate is the first official in a long time. So if you last had a look at 1.0.2, it&#8217;s time to take another peak.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you haven&#8217;t switched yet, you can swing by <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> and pickup a Mac on the way to TextMate. It&#8217;s not now, nor ever, going Windows.</p>
