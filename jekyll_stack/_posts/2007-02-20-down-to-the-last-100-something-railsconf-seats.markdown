<p><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf</a> has been racing towards a sell-out and is now almost there. We&#8217;re down to our last 100-something seats out of the 1200 being offered. So if you&#8217;re still waiting for boss approval on the expenditure or want to see how close you can get to having seat #1200, I&#8217;d start thinking about chickening out and secure that seat.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to have a party come May.</p>
