<p>The extracted adapter gems are now available for install from the gems.rubyonrails.org server. Say you want the Oracle adapter installed, you just do gem install activerecord-oracle-adapter. All the extracted gems are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>activerecord-firebird-adapter</li>
	<li>activerecord-frontbase-adapter</li>
	<li>activerecord-openbase-adapter</li>
	<li>activerecord-oracle-adapter</li>
	<li>activerecord-sqlserver-adapter</li>
	<li>activerecord-sybase-adapter</li>
</ul>
<p>The mysql, postgresql, and sqlite adapters are still included in Rails core.</p>
<p>These will be released to the standard Ruby repository alongside Rails 2.0 when that reaches final.</p>
