<p>So know we know what all that sexy script.aculo.us was been grown for! Thomas Fuchs has <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/articles/2005/11/24/fluxiom">unveiled a taste of Fluxiom</a>. It&#8217;s an asset manager that looks especially nice for keeping track of stock images, reusable graphics, and everything else that makes a creative firm spin. Very cool looking and decidedly sexy. Oh, and of course all powered by Rails.</p>
