<p><a href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a> is the official host for Ruby on Rails and as such gets all the action for cool integration efforts. We have a bunch in store that&#8217;ll turn the current state of &#8220;easy to get going&#8221; into &#8220;<i>ridiculously</i> easy to get flying&#8221;.</p>
<p>While that is cooking, Scott Baron has written up an excellent guide on <a href="http://trac.elitists.net/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/EJOnTextDrive">how to install Elite Journal on TextDrive</a> without using another vhost. He even created a <a href="http://elitists.textdriven.com/ej/">testing blog</a> just to prove it.</p>
<p>For those of you that don&#8217;t have a TextDrive account yet, I&#8217;d like to reiterate the point that this is one of the best ways to support the development of Rails (short of <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/">contributing</a> patches or documentation).</p>
<p>They have some <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/plans/">incredibly reasonable plans</a>, an excellent environment for Ruby on Rails development, a staff that actually cares deeply about Ruby and Rails, and they&#8217;re contributing 50% of the profits on Rails signups to further development of the framework.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re still stuck elsewhere, now is the time to think about migrating.</p>
<p><i>And that concludes this shameless plug for TextDrive hidding behind the appearance of a documentation announcement.</i></p>
