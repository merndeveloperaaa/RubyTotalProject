<p>Pat Eyler is running a Ruby blogging contest, sponsored by Apress, and the first month&#8217;s topic is <a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2007/01/win-books-by-blogging.html">Rails Revelations: How Rails made me a better programmmer</a>. Read the requirements at that post, and then write up your article and post a link to it in the comments <a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2007/01/win-books-by-blogging.html#comments">here</a>. Pat Eyler, Apress editor Jason Gilmore, and Jarkko Laine will judge the entries, picking a winner in February. Go to it!</p>
