<p>Tobias Luekte has set up a Trac site for his <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/articles/read/2">Typo</a> weblog engine. Typo has a slew of neat features including:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="caps">XML</span>-<span class="caps">RPC</span> backend implementing the metaweblog api. MarsEdit and other desktop clients work great.</li>
	<li>Comments</li>
	<li>Textile by way of RedCloth</li>
	<li>fulltext search</li>
	<li>RSS2 and Atom export</li>
	<li>CommentRSS export</li>
	<li>Some use of caching and sweepers</li>
</ul>
<p>So whether you&#8217;d like to run it or not, you&#8217;ll probably do well by having a look at <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac.cgi/browser/trunk/">the source</a>.</p>
