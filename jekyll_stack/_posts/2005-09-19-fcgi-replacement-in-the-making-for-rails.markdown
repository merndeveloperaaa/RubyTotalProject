<p>Zed A. Shaw is working on a <span class="caps">SCGI</span> implementation in pure Ruby that&#8217;ll hopefully make for a more pleasant experience than <span class="caps">FCGI</span> once ready. He just <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.rails/22321">announced</a> the v0.3 of the <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/projects/scgi_rails/"><span class="caps">SCGI</span> Rails Runner</a> and I&#8217;d encourage everyone to go have a look. It may not yet be ready to dethrone <span class="caps">FCGI</span>, but with enough exposure, it&#8217;ll hopefully soon be a viable alternative.</p>
