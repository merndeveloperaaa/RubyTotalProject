<p>I&#8217;m exceedingly happy to <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/redesign2005/">see the rapid progress</a> of the team appointed to redesign ruby-lang.org. The old website served us well, but this redesign is going to make it even easier to declare 2005 The Year of Ruby.</p>
<p>While both designs are great, I&#8217;ve already fallen in love with John&#8217;s &#8220;Ruby Red&#8221; 3.0. The gem is beautiful, the composition is great, and hey, it features Rails on the front page ;). Nix the scoped search into just a single search box and add the participation stuff from clean and we&#8217;re definitely rolling.</p>
<p>Congrats to _why and the rest of the team behind this!</p>
