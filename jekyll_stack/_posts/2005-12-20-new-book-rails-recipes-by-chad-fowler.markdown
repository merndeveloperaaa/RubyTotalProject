As the co-founder of RubyCentral, co-creator of RubyGems, and co-organizer of RubyConf and RailsConf, Chad is seriously well positioned to teach you a thing or two about Ruby and Rails.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s exactly what <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a> is all about. Small, concrete guides to doing specific things with Ruby on Rails. And at projected 350 pages, it&#8217;s going to be packed with goodies for sure. I&#8217;ll be working together with Chad to ensure that the recipes include a good number of 37signals favorites, so you can benefit from all the tips and tricks that make Basecamp, Backpack, and the rest of the suite sing.</p>
<p>Chad is aiming to have Rails Recipes out as a beta book on February 1st.</p>
