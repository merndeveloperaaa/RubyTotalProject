<p>ActiveReload has just released <a href="http://activereload.net/2007/7/9/warehouse-subversion-browser-released">Warehouse</a>, a simple subversion browser written using Rails.  It sports a beautiful UI and can handle the mundane task of user and permission management for you.  It&#8217;s also being distributed in a unique fashion for most Rails applications.  Instead of being hosted, it is sold and downloaded to be installed on your own server.</p>
