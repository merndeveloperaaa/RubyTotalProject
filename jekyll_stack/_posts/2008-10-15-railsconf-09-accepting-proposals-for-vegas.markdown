<p><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/">RailsConf 2009</a> is going to Las Vegas, baby. It&#8217;s happening from May 4-7 at the Las Vegas Hilton. Last year was an astounding success with probably the best session line-up of any of the many RailsConfs we&#8217;ve had yet. We&#8217;re hell bent on repeating that for 2009, but we need your help.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/cfp/46">call for proposals</a> has opened and will stay open until February 17th, 2009. That&#8217;s a really long call for proposals and we&#8217;re doing it to get even more timely information available for the conference. If Rails 3.0 magically appears in January, we want to make sure there are sessions covering it.</p>
<p>The registration for the conference will open in January of 2009.</p>
