<p>The <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/grid?date=2008-05-29">session schedule for RailsConf</a> is now available. A very packed lineup across Thursday through Sunday.</p>
<p>Also, the <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/register">early bird deal</a> is ending April 10th. After that, the price of admission will jump another $100. So if you&#8217;re planning to go, getting your ticket before April 10th would be an easy way to save a Benjamin.</p>
