<p>Rob Harwood spotted this very interesting trend from <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&range=2y&size=large&compare_sites=rubyonrails.org&y=r&url=ruby-lang.org">Alexa describing the rise of Ruby reach as Rails enters the scene</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://web.rubyonrails.com/pictures/ruby_reach.png" align="center" alt="" /></p>
<p>Harwood interprets the correlation:</p>
<blockquote>Forget the hype over Rails &#8212; not important. Forget the anti-hype too &#8212; irrelevant. Instead, just look at this graph from Alexa.com. See any correlation? Rails is a killer app, regardless of hype or anti-hype. As soon as Rails appeared on the scene, Ruby has experienced a 200% increase in web traffic over three months.</blockquote>
