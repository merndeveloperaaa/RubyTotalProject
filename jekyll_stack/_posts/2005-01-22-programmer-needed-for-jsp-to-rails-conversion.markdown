<p>Gately&#8217;s would like to dump their <a href="http://www.gatelys.com/"><span class="caps">JSP</span>-powered shop</a> and upgrade to Rails. They&#8217;re looking for Rails talent to help them do just that:</p>
<blockquote>We need a developer who is proficient in (and hates) <span class="caps">JSP</span> for a contract-to-hire position which would involve replacing a <span class="caps">JSP</span> app with a Rails app for a growing e-tailer in the Denver, CO area. Would prefer local talent, but would consider teleworkers from anywhere with the right skills. Please contact me (Solomon White, solo [at] gatelys [dotcom]) if you feel you might be a fit.</blockquote>
