<p>We&#8217;ve just launched a mild refresh of the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org">rubyonrails.org</a> site. It now runs on <a href="http://radiantcms.org/">Radiant</a> through Passenger at <a href="http://www.slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> and includes a nip and tuck in various places along with a couple of new pages. Read about <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/deploy">how we prefer to deploy Rails applications</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/ecosystem">the ecosystem</a> that has sprung up around Rails, and see the much expanded list of <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/applications">prolific Rails applications</a>.</p>
