<p>The party in Berlin came to an end all too soon. I had a blast there and so did everyone else it seemed. Such a fantastic atmosphere and group of people. If you weren&#8217;t able to make it, you can peruse the <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/pub/w/61/presentations.html">presentation slides</a> or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/x180/sets/72157602045833613/">the pictures</a>. Thanks to everyone who made it possible and to all who was able to come.</p>
