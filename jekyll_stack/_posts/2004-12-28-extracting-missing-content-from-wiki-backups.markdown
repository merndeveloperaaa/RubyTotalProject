<p>The Rails <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/HomePage">wiki</a> has taken a few beatings, but now it&#8217;s running in high class with proper rollback protection, so we should now have a stable host to fill with content. So what better place to start than to extract all the missing content from the two backups we have that might contain missing pages:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.37signals.com/rails/wiki/HomePage.html">Static backup of changes from late November to late December</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://lists.rubyonrails.org:2750/rails/show/HomePage">Dynamic backup that might contain missing pages in the latest move</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to figure out what&#8217;s missing is to go look for your own content. If you miss some of that, then please do retrieve it from one of the backups. But that shouldn&#8217;t hold enterprising individuals back that want to help with the restoration. Dig in!</p>
