<p>Despite my initial resistance, Olivier Hericord pressed on and prevailed &#8212; against my own odds &#8212; to produce a remixed version of the new logo that was <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2004/12/29/variations-on-a-railed-theme/#comments">greeted</a> by the majority of the community as an improvement. And I concur. The remix signals less rigidness and more fun than the original &#8212; two important properties to Rails development.</p>

<p>This process also proved that patches are not just for software. Once you <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2004/12/28/open-sourcing-the-rails-logo/">share the source</a>, improvements are bound to occur. That&#8217;s another reason that I&#8217;m welcoming the remix. The community protested, the community acted, the community celebrated change, and now, hopefully, the community <i>moved on</i>.</p>
