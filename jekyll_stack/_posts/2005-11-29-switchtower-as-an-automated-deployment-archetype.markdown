<p>Mike Clark has written a provocative article entitled <a href="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/cgi-bin/pragauto.cgi/Tools/SwitchTowerDeploymentArchetype.rdoc">SwitchTower as an Automated Deployment Archetype</a> in which he suggests that developers of all stripes ought to consider <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17">SwitchTower</a> for their deployment system, whether or not they are using Ruby on Rails. I know I&#8217;ve heard at least one story of someone using SwitchTower to manage a <span class="caps">PHP</span> application. Anyone care to share any other success stories of SwitchTower managing a non-Rails application? Any gotchas potential users might want to be aware of?</p>
