<p>One of the reasons the Ruby and Rails community is so strong and passionate is because of the awesome regional conferences that happen all around the globe on a yearly basis.  Previously on this blog I&#8217;ve gone through the list and highlighted a bunch, but since then <a href="http://RubyThere.com">Ruby There</a> has popped up.</p>
<p>So instead of listing out all the conferences I&#8217;m just going to send you over to <a href="http://RubyThere.com">RubyThere.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you dig the Ruby and Rails community I highly recommend you attend one of <a href="http://RubyThere.com">these events</a> and maybe volunteer to help or even sponsor if you can afford to.  It&#8217;s hard work putting on a conference, and most of the organizers do it for the love of the community (and little to no compensation).</p>
