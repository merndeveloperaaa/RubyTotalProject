<p>David Geary has moved into <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/dgeary/20050714">the Rails caf&eacute;</a> and is now spending a considerable amount of time telling others about this place. Most recently, he did just that again at the No Fluff, Just Stuff symposium in Salt Lake City. His presentation left <a href="http://jroller.com/page/dgeary?entry=rails_drops_jaws">more than a few jaws hanging</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Near the end of that demo, I looked into the audience and saw something that I&#8217;d never seen at a <span class="caps">NFJS</span> symposium: a woman sitting at a table near the front of the room was looking at me with her mouth wide open and the most incredulous look on her face. It was almost like I could read her mind: &#8220;This can&#8217;t be real!&#8221;, she must&#8217;ve been thinking. I pointed at her and said &#8220;That&#8217;s pretty amazing, huh?&#8221; She nodded a reply, but the look of astonishment never left her face.</blockquote>
<p>The language and environment you choose to work with those make a large difference on productivity. Smart people can succeed with nearly anything, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they shouldn&#8217;t look for that edge whenever they can find it.</p>
