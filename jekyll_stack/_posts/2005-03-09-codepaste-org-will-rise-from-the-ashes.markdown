<p>Bruce Williams is <a href="http://www.codefluency.com/blog/?search=category%3AProjects">promising the return of codepaste.org</a>, which used to be the preferred paste site in #rubyonrails before it went away. For a long time. But now it&#8217;s coming back and Bruce is even promising to package it up in a <span class="caps">GEM</span> shortly, so it can be installed locally. Yay!</p>
