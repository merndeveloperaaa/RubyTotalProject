<p>Matt Grayson is another Python programmer that despite his love for Python &#8220;&#8230;haven&#8217;t done much Python lately&#8221;. He <a href="http://www.eitheror.org/archive/2005/02/i_didnt_mean_fo.php">blames Rails</a>, which he declares &#8220;&#8230;is worth the hype.&#8221;. On the prospect of seeing Python on Rails, he offers:</p>
<blockquote>The closest thing I&#8217;d found to Rails in Python is a combination of CherryPy, SQLObject and Cheetah. But as much as I like each one of those pieces individually, they won&#8217;t ever fit together like Rails &#8211; which is why I don&#8217;t have a lot of optimism for things like Subway. I&#8217;ve got nothing against Subway. Could they pull it off and put together a really good Python web framework? Sure. But, given the track record of past attempts at web frameworks within the Python community, I won&#8217;t hold my breath.</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://blog.unquiet.net/">Jake from Maui</a> is yet another Python programmer that has been <a href="http://blog.unquiet.net/archives/2005/02/22/time-to-take-a-different-track/">getting into Ruby through Rails</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Every time my work took extra time, it&rsquo;s because I was expecting a level of complexity that wasn&rsquo;t there. Wow. It&rsquo;s not often that one of the tools I use humbles me, but finally I&rsquo;ve found something that allows me to write code as fast as I think.</blockquote>
