<p>Chris Petrilli <a href="http://www.amber.org/~petrilli/archive/2005/03/08/the_redherring_of_performance.html">talks about the delusions of grandeur</a> that lots of programmers indulge in when they pick an environment based on performance concerns:</p>
<blockquote>Write in whatever language you feel most comfortable and productive in. I know quite a few Python (either Zope or SkunkWeb) based websites that are running millions of hits per day. That puts them in the top 1%. Your site isn&rsquo;t like that. If you think it is, you&rsquo;re wrong. Maybe someday it might be, but deal with it then.</blockquote>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t agree more. For almost a year, Basecamp was served well by a single, if beefy, server running web, application, and database services. We&#8217;ve just recently moved beyond that &mdash; <em>after success was achieved</em>. There&#8217;s no reason to gold platen a possible flop.</p>
