<p>I love how so many conferences are recording their sessions. Paris on Rails is another of those conferences and they&#8217;ve recently published <a href="http://2008.parisonrails.org/">their recordings as both video and audio</a>. Most of these sessions are in French, but Michael Koziarski did a great session on Rails Performance that&#8217;s in English and so was my iChat Q&amp;A session.</p>
