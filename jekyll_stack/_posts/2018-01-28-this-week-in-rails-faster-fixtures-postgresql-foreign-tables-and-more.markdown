This week there were 22 contributors to Rails including contributions from 4 first-timers. Thanks!

### [Multi-statement query for inserting fixtures](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/31422)

This change constructs a single query for inserting fixtures from different tables. This change reduced the time to load around 700 fixtures from 15 seconds to 8 seconds! üèé

### [Custom handling of exceptions that are discarded](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/30622)

This change allows a job that is discarded to be handled by a custom handler. The **_retry\_on_** already provides the ability for a custom handler and now same has been added to **_discard\_on_** handler.
