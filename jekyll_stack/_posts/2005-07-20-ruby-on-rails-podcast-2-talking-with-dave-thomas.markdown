<p>Scott Barron has released the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">second Ruby on Rails podcast</a>. It sounds a whole lot better than the first and there&#8217;s an even more interesting guest on the show: Dave Thomas. Get the story about how Dave got to be a Pragmatic Programmer and how he got in Ruby. And of course the full lowdown on the new book, upcoming mini-books, and much more.</p>
<p>And of course, it has the latest news from the Rails work. Check it out, yo!</p>
