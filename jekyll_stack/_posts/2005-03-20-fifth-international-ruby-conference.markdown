<p>The <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/">fifth international Ruby conference</a> is happening in San Diego, California from October 14th until 16th. You have to come. I went last year and had the most wonderful three days in the company of most of the best Ruby hackers. I&#8217;m so most definitely going again this year. You have to come.</p>
