<p>As hosts start expanding their hosting options, it&#8217;s becoming more important for folks to get together and share their deployment knowledge and trade war stories.  <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2007/01/23/announcement-new-ruby-on-rails-deployment-group">Robby Russell thought it was time</a>, and started a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-deployment">rails-deployment</a> Google Group, as well as #rails-deployment on Freenode.  In just a short time, it&#8217;s already attracted nearly 400 members, including experts from some prominent rails hosts like <a href="http://planetargon.com/"><span class="caps">PLANET</span> <span class="caps">ARGON</span></a>, <a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>, and <a href="http://railsmachine.com">Rails Machine</a>.</p>
