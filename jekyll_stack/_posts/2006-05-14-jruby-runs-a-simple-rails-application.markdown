<p>The chaps at the JRuby project has been making rapid progress in anticipation of JavaOne. They finally got a simple, but <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/05/and-they-said-jruby-was-dead.html">complete Rails application running</a>. I hear it&#8217;s not breaking any speed records, but it&#8217;s a great first step regardless. This should bring comfort to any developers stuck in large, mono-culture organizations that mandate the <span class="caps">JVM</span> as its sole alter. JRuby is a great way to sneak Rails in the backdoor.</p>
