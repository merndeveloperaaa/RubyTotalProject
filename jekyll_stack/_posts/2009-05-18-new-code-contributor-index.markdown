<p><a href="http://www.hashref.com/">Xavier Noria</a> (code) and <a href="http://www.josespinal.com/">José Espinal</a> (design) have created an <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/">awesome code contributor index</a> for Rails core submissions. It&#8217;s being updated automatically every night and tracks the number of commits and which particular commits to individuals in the community. You can even track the commits over time, as in who&#8217;s been most active this month.</p>
<p>The site now lives at <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/">contributors.rubyonrails.org</a>. Thanks to Xavier and José for putting in the work on this!</p>
