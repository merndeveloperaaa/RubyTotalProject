<p>We&#8217;ve pushed out the third release candidate for 1.0 of Rails. This release most prominently fixes a memory leak with render_component (which affected Typo among others), the scaffolding bug, and a number of other small things. Please do upgrade. If you&#8217;re already running 0.14.1 (RC2), then you don&#8217;t need to change anything in the application.</p>
