<p>On a the topic of <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> vs Ruby on Rails on the ruby-talk mailing list, Christian Romney wrote a long analysis over his experience with the two. Here&#8217;s my choice bit:</p>
<blockquote>I disagree that <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> is  more productive than RoR. I have been <span class="caps">FAR</span> more productive with RoR after just a few months of learning Ruby and a few weeks of using RoR than I am with .<span class="caps">NET</span> even though I&#8217;ve been coding on the MS platform for 10 years, with half of that time spent almost exclusively working on web applications.</blockquote>
<p>Romney especially likes Active Record and the &#8220;architectural guidance&#8221; of the framework. But there&#8217;s definitely also some love for .<span class="caps">NET</span> where he especially likes the transaction support and enterprise features like message queueing. <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/msg/47655971c922b9e4">Read the full thing</a>.</p>
