Apologies to those of you still using feed readers, but unfortunately
we’ve got to change our feed URL. I’ve known for a while that the
feed has been broken, but my attempts at getting FeedBurner to pick
it up after our migration has come to nothing. As you are probably
aware, Google hasn’t shown FeedBurner much love and no-one appears to
have the login details for the account so we’ve hit a brick wall in
what we can do.

Sorry again for the inconvenience.
