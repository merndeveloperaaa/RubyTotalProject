<p><a href="http://scott.elitists.net/journal/view/14">Another installment</a> in Scott Baron&#8217;s series &#8220;Rails Application Walk-through&#8221; today. This time he&#8217;s tackling the use of validations by utilizing both the built-in ones and a couple of custom validations. Excellent stuff!</p>
