<p>The first <a href="http://railsconf.org/">official Rails conference</a> has <a href="http://www.railsconf.org/pages/registration">opened its doors to registrations</a> and is tempting with a wide variety of auxiliary announcements. While all the sessions haven&#8217;t been announced yet, the <a href="http://railsconf.org/articles/2006/02/02/announcing-railsconf-2006-keynotes">keynotes are final</a>. We got Martin Fowler, Paul Graham, Dave Thomas, and yours truly all lined up to deliver anchors of blast.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a limited number of seats, so just like RubyConf this year, we expect RailsConf to sell out well in advance. That&#8217;s one great reason to register now, another is the $400 super early-bird price that only lasts until the end of the month. After that it&#8217;s $475 for a while and finally $550 once we get past April 18th. I doubt we&#8217;ll have any seats left to sell at $550, though.</p>
<p>As if you needed additional reason, the first 100 lucky people who sign up and donate at least $40 to charity will get free access to a pre-conference day called <a href="http://railsconf.org/pages/guidebook">The Rails Guidebook</a> where Dave Thomas and Mike Clark will teach you Ruby on Rails. So if you&#8217;re really quick, that&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity to get even more value out of your trip to Chicago in June.</p>
<p>Yes, in case you forgot, RailsConf 2006 is going down in Chicago from June 22nd through 26th at <a href="http://railsconf.org/pages/hotel">the Wyndham O&rsquo;Hare hotel</a>. Three days of happy programming for people who love beautiful code. I expect to see you there!</p>
