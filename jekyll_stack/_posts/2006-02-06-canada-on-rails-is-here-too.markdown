<p>In the flurry of enthusiasm over the official RailsConf, <a href="http://canadaonrails.com">Canada on Rails</a> seems to have been a bit forgotten. It&#8217;s going down in Vancouver on April 13th and 14th. I&#8217;ll be speaking there, so will Thomas Fuchs (Mr. Scriptaculous), Dave Astels, David Black, and <a href="http://canadaonrails.com/conference.html">many other Rails celebrities</a>. Do check it out too. We know that you can&#8217;t get enough of Rails anyway, so two conferences should be all the double fun.</p>
