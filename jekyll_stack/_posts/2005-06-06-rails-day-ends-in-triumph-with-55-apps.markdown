<p><a href="http://railsday.com/">Rails Day</a> had a great turnout with <a href="http://railsday.com/svn/qualifiers">55(!) projects</a> crossing the finish line. That&#8217;s a lot of interesting code generated in no time at all. It&#8217;s so interesting in fact that the <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/06/1135222&amp;tid=156&amp;tid=8">developer section on Slashdot just picked it up</a> &#8212; hi guys!</p>
<p>Now for the judging. We&#8217;ll be announcing a week&#8217;s worth of slip on that considering the massive amount of projects to look through, but you&#8217;ll have plenty of projects to keep you entertained in the mean time.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all who finished.</p>
