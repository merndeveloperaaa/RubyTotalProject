<p>The <a href="http://developer.apple.com/">Apple Developer Connection</a> has a nice Ruby on Rails tutorial called <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/rubyonrails.html">Using Ruby on Rails for Web Development on Mac OS X</a>.  As the title suggests, it is aimed at getting OS X users off the ground with Rails.</p>
<p>The Apple Developer Connection doesn&#8217;t supply any attribution for their articles, but this one was written by none other than <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom">Mike Clark</a>, who along with <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> runs the always-sold-out <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic Studio</a> series of Ruby on Rails and Ajax training.</p>
<p>Cheers to Mike for taking the time out of his busy schedule to write up a great tutorial.</p>
