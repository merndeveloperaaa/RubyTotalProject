<p>Jonathan Nolen and his buddy David has been having a lot of fun <a href="http://www.jnolen.com/blog/2005/05/first_day_on_ra.html">practicing eXtreme Programming with Rails</a> over the weekend. He&#8217;s most impressed by the support for functional testing:</p>
<blockquote>With Rails, however, you can easily functional testing &#8212; where they go, how they&#8217;re routed to get there, and whether or not they have the data you expect when they finally render. And it&#8217;s done in <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/28#page235">a dead-simple way</a>. No Cactus, no mock container, no extra framework to install. It&#8217;s all built right in. Now, it won&#8217;t cover everything &#8212; browser differences, javascript, etc. But it covers so much more than we&#8217;ve been able to manage in our Java project.</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Jonathan. We&#8217;ve tried really hard to make testing so easy that it feels like fun, not a chore. Now that you&#8217;ve checked out functional tests, do dig deeper into the <a href="http://scott.elitists.net/users/scott/posts/mockery">great mock support in Rails</a>.</p>
