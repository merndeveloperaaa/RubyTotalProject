<p>As Mongrel continues to bubble to the top of the preferred production stack, we&#8217;ve started to evaluate web servers on their proxy rather than their <span class="caps">FCGI</span> support. The lighttpd crew has heard this change of priorities loud and clear and the coming version will feature a brand new <a href="http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/07/18/mod_proxy_core-commited-to-svn">mod_proxy_core</a> module, which aims to rectify all the troubles of the old mod_proxy.</p>
<p>Jan Kneschke and crew are busy preparing this proxy module for release with <a href="http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/07/26/1-4-12-becomes-1-5-0">lighttpd 1.5.0</a>, but you can already now get your toes wet with the <a href="http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/07/24/pre-release-lighttpd-1-4-12-20060724-0947-tar-gz">pre-release</a>.</p>
<p>All hail <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/essay/2006/06/webaspipe">the http pipe</a>!</p>
