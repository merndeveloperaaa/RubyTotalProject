<p>Luke Sutton <a href="http://www.mr-eel.com/journal/archives/15">can&#8217;t help but share</a> his recent discovery:</p>
<blockquote>OK look, I don&rsquo;t wanna seem like a total fan-boy and I know the hype has been almost too much. I know you&rsquo;re probably sick of hearing this and I know you are probably a bit dubious &mdash; sceptisim is an admirable trait. I really really really have to say this though; Ruby on Rails totally kicks arse.</blockquote>
