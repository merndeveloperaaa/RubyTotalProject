<p>Here&#8217;s a good idea: Use a hot new technology to help kids prepare to create the next hot new technology.</p>
<p><a href="http://slash7.com">Amy Hoy</a>, <a href="http://www.brainspl.at/">Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a> and <a href="http://www.casimircreative.com/">Jeff Casimir</a> are doing just that and calling it <a href="http://www.workshopforgood.org/">Workshop for Good</a>. On Saturday, May 20th and Sunday, May 21st, in Washington, D.C. <a href="http://www.slash7.com/articles/2006/04/17/teaching-rails-for-charity-in-d-c">Amy</a>, <a href="http://www.brainspl.at/articles/2006/04/10/rails-workshop-for-good">Ezra</a> and Jeff will be teaching an intensive Rails workshop. All (i.e. 100%) of the proceeds from attendance fees ($400 regular, $200 for students) will go towards buying stuff like computers for the students of <a href="http://www.chavezschools.org/">César Chávez Public Charter School</a>.</p>
<p>Amy Hoy has been giving back to the Rails community with education almost since day one. You may have gotten over the initial hurdles yourself with one of her <a href="http://www.slash7.com/articles/2005/02/22/mvc-the-most-vexing-conundrum">accessible tutorials</a> or <a href="http://www.slash7.com/images/mvc.png">clarifying visual aids</a>. Ezra Zygmuntowicz singlehandedly built one of the first substantial real world Rails applications, the <a href="http://yakimaherald.com/">Yakima Herald Website</a> and is currently working on a Rails book for the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">Pragmatic Programmers</a>. Both bring substantial experience with Rails to the workshop.</p>
<p>Last I heard there were 23 spots left so get on the list while you still can. Take this opportunity to both learn Rails and promote a great cause. Killing two birds with one stone is seriously agile.</p>
