Hello open sourcerer!  

Here's [Kasper](https://twitter.com/kaspth) rushing straight from the bullpen to the printers to report: Slow week, but we'll get through it.  

Just kidding! Rails 5 is here.  

In fact, to really underline the magnitude of this achievement please play [this music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5umEUBDXfU0) while you read.

## Featured

### [Rails 5 is here!](https://rubyonrails.org/2016/6/30/Rails-5-0-final)

After a period of betas Rails 5.0 has now been released. The headline features are Action Cable and a mode primed for API-only apps.  
  
There are also loads of other goodies which we're covered here before. Check out [our archives](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/archive) or comb through the [9999 commits themselves](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/releases/5-0-0/commits).

### [Guides updated for Rails 5](http://guides.rubyonrails.org)

If you'd like a more high level overview there's also new guides ready.  
  
You can find tips on [upgrading](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html), there's a new version of the [testing guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html) — and there are the full [release notes](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/5_0_release_notes.html), which has a lot of details.

### [Rails 5: made by you and me](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/releases/5-0-0/contributors)

Rails 5 wouldn't be possible without the 948 people who put in free time to help make these releases happen. A roaring thank you goes out to every contributor big and small. ❤️
