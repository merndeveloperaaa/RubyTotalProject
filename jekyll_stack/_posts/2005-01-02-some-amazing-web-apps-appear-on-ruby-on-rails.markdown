<p>Luis de la Rosa is <a href="http://www.luisdelarosa.com/blog/2005/01/my_predictions_.html">predicting</a> the highlights of 2005, which includes plenty of Java goodies, such as Eclipse and Java 1.5 by default on OS X Tiger (that would be a nice move). But more importantly, Luis picks the rise of dynamic languages for spot number five:</p>
<blockquote>5. Dynamic languages gain ground: Ruby and Groovy increase in usage, but no full-time jobs appear. Some amazing web apps appear on Ruby on Rails.</blockquote>
<p>Luis made a safe bet predicting that &#8220;amazing web apps&#8221; will come barring the banner of Ruby on Rails: It happened on the 1st day of 2005! <a href="http://www.43things.com">43things.com</a> launched and it is indeed an amazing web application that has the most lofty of goals: Push human ambition higher!</p>
<p>Luckily, Luis is already kinda wrong on &#8220;no full-time jobs appear, will be fully wrong half-way into the New Year, and even <i>silly wrong</i> by the end of December 2005. Companies around the world are already employing full-time Railers, like &#8221;http://www.combustionlabs.com/&#8220;&gt;Combustion Labs</a> (4 developers),  &#8221;http://www.robotcoop.com/&#8220;&gt;The Robot Coop</a> (4 developers), &#8221;http://www.collaboraid.biz/&#8220;&gt;Collaboraid</a> (3 developers), &#8221;http://www.basesys.com/&#8220;&gt;Base Systems</a> (2 developers), &#8221;http://www.37signals.com&quot;&gt;37signals</a> (2 developers), and of course a legion of independent consultants and tech departments in tons of universities and big corporations (<a href="http://one.textdrive.com/pipermail/rails/2004-December/000892.html">read more</a>).</p>
<p>But I agree with Luis that <i>big companies</i> won&#8217;t be picking up Ruby on Rails for real before 2006. So that&#8217;ll leave the front runners and early adopters among small companies with a significant competitive advantage for the entirety of 2005. Congratulations, guys.</p>
