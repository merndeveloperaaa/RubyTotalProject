It's been 10 years since we last updated the Rails identity, so with [Rails 5 just around the corner][rails-5], we thought it was finally time for a fresh look for a new day. This is it! We have a brand new logo, a brand new site design, and lots of lovely new illustrations. 

We can thank Basecamp designer [Jamie Dihiansan][jamied] for the awesome new look. The brief was that Rails shouldn't feel slick. It should be warm, approachable, and welcoming. Rails is in a different place from where it was in 2004. We aren't courting cutting-edge early adopters, so we can lay off the gradients. Rails is now for everyone and our site should reflect that.

## The Rails Doctrine

In concert with the new look, I wrote the eight major tenets of [The Rails Doctrine][doctrine]. It's still a bit of a work in progress, but please do give it a read if you want to understand deeper the values and practices that underpin us as a framework and a community.

## A new video is coming

I was going to record a new video for the homepage, but since we're just on the cusp on some changes to Rails 5 that'll change things a bit, I'm holding off until beta2 (which should be out shortly). In the mean time, you can enjoy the introduction to Action Cable. But rest assured that it'll soon be replaced by a new, proper introduction.

Hope you all enjoy the new look. Now let's ship Rails 5!
