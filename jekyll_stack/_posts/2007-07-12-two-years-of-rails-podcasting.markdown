<p>Two years ago today, <a href="http://twitter.com/JoyentScott">Scott Barron</a> published the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/programs/1/episodes/david_heinemeier_hansson">first episode</a> of the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails Podcast</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/articles/two-years-of-the-ruby-on-rails-podcast">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a></p>

<p>Wow, has it been two years already?  Geoffrey&#8217;s been a major positive force in the Rails community even longer then that, starting with the humble <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/tools/pluralize/octopus">Pluralizer</a>, which helped us all figure out what table names our ActiveRecord models were supposed to be using.  For his next podcast, he&#8217;s turning the tables and letting himself be interviewed by <a href="http://hivelogic.com">Dan Benjamin</a>.  Be sure to send in some challenging questions (see Geoffrey&#8217;s blog post for details).</p>
<p>Congrats on the milestone, Geoffrey, Scott, and everyone else that&#8217;s been involved with the Rails Podcast!</p>
