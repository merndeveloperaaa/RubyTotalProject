<p>But hold your horses on installing it for a production Rails system. At least <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/ticket/2245">one compatibility issue</a> has been spotted between Rails 0.13.1 and Ruby 1.8.3. Over the next days, we&#8217;ll look for any other issues and be sure to resolve them shortly.</p>
<p><b><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</b> The Rails beta gems now include a fix for the incompatibility.</p>
