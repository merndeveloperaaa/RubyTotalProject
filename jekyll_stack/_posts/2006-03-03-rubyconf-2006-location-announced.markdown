<p>Hot on the heals of the fervor behind the upcoming <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a>, the location of RubyConf 2006 has been announced. This fall it&#8217;s going to be in Denver, Colorado from October 20-22, 2006.</p>
<p>Two years ago we had about 70 people at RubyConf. This past year we stopped accepting signups months before the event when 200 tickets were sold. This year&#8217;s conference promises to have huge demand.</p>
<p>Venue, schedule and registration should be opening up in the Spring. Keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org/">RubyConf site</a> as more details trickle out.</p>
<p>Big thanks to <a href="http://www.rubypowerandlight.com">David Black</a> and the others behind <a href="http://rubycentral.org">RubyCentral</a> for their tireless work setting all this up.</p>
