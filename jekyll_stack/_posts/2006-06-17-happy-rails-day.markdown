<p><a href="http://railsday2006.com/">RailsDay 2006</a> is in progress!  Teams around the world will be working furiously all day to produce the best application possible in 24 hours.</p>
<p>This year, you can watch the action as it happens with live(ish) <a href="http://spectate.railsday2006.com/">commit stats</a> and a <a href="https://railsday.campfirenow.com/073dc">Rails Day campfire</a>.  Not quite a spectator sport yet, but <a href="http://project.ioni.st/post/837#post-837">entertaining</a> none-the-less.</p>
