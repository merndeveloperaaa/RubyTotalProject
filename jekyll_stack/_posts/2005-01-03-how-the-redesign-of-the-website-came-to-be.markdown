<p>Jakob Skjerning is sharing some <a href="http://mentalized.net/journal/2005/01/03/ruby_on_rails_website_refurbished/index.asp">additional details</a> on what we went through creating the new uniform look for Ruby on Rails:</p>
<blockquote>The project was pretty interesting since we wanted to give the existing parts of the Rails web presence a uniform look&rsquo;n&rsquo;feel, mixing Instiki with Trac with RDoc with new additions WordPress and Hierarki. That&rsquo;s 3 different scripting languages and 5 different ways of templating.</blockquote>
