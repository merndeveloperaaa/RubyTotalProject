<p>The Robot Co-op follows up on 43things with <a href="http://www.43places.com">43places</a> that narrows the scope from goal to destination. Record where you want to go, meet others with the same destination in mind, and read stories from people who&#8217;ve been. It&#8217;s a great idea. And a great follow-up to 43things. Congratulations on the launch. Now, <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/104044">what to do in Hawaii</a>?</p>
