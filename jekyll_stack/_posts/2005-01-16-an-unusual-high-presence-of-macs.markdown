<p>Most of  the core developers in the Rails community are using Macs and they&#8217;re certainly not afraid to say so. In the hours surrounding the latest MacWorld, the #rubyonrails channel could just have well have been renamed the Mac Enthusiast channel (actually, it did have the title &#8220;Have you ordered your Mac Mini yet?&#8221; for a brief moment). But I didn&#8217;t know that we actually had an evangelist among the Rails users that was featured on Apple.com:</p>

<p>Gianni is known as &#8220;yipstar&#8221; on #rubyonrails who says &#8220;I&#8217;m working on a bunch. A Flash/Ruby ecommerce site for my brothers Tee-Shirt company. A couple small rails site for my old employer, simple stuff. And I&#8217;m almost done with my delicous clone supped up on steroids.&#8221; Rock on, Gianni!</p>
