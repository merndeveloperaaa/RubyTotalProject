<p>We&#8217;ve been part of a Slashdot posting once before, but this is the first time that Rails is actually the <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/21/1514234&amp;tid=156">primary topic of one</a>. So a proper welcome to all the Slashdotters flowing in from the article about Curt Hibbs&#8217; great new Rails tutorial on O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s ONLamp.</p>
<p>Hopefully we&#8217;ll survive the onslaught and a few will stick around!</p>
