<p><a href="http://blog.x180.net">James Duncan Davidson</a> and <a href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom">Mike Clark</a> has delivered on their first large, commercial Rails project together: <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/betterbooks/">VitalSource Bookshelf</a>. It&#8217;s a book store that aims to make it as easy to buy your ebooks as your music. What&#8217;s special is that it includes a native application, ala iTunes, that works together with the Rails-powered store.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://blog.x180.net/2005/08/its_official.html">James&#8217; announcement</a>, there&#8217;s also a note from Willie Abrams of VitalSource. He writes about using Rails: &#8220;As for Ruby on Rails? Wow. A lot of things would have to change for us to consider doing a web application any other way. It is that good.&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thanks, Willie. And congratulations to both Mike, James, and VitalSource for shipping!</p>
