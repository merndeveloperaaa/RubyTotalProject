<p>Ara Howard and Doug Fales has a <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8217">great article on Linux Journal</a> exploring Rails through a conversation. They talk about how thinks work building a small blog engine and touches on many of the Ruby facilities that Rails employ to do its magic. They also talk a bit about why some of the reactions to Rails have been so explosive and what kind of fears that are triggered when new tech hits the street. Great stuff.</p>
