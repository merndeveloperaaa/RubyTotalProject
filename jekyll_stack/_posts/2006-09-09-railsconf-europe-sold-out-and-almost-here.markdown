<p><a href="http://europe.railsconf.org">RailsConf Europe</a> is imminent. Come next Thursday and hundreds of Rails programmers will descend on London for two days of talks, tricks, and perhaps a pony show.</p>
<p>Despite an initially slower opening (compared to the 1 week sell-out madness of the Chicago fair!), RailsConf Europe has indeed managed to sell out the slated 300 seats and then some. All in all, I believe we&#8217;ll almost be pushing 400 people including speakers, staff, and all attendants. That&#8217;s pretty fantastic!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m especially pleased to see the <a href="http://europe.railsconf.org/pages/schedule">final schedule</a> too. Mostly because it looks very little like the Chicago one. We have different headliners like Kathy Sierra and Jim Weirich and the individual sessions are also completely their own. It&#8217;s great that we&#8217;ve been able to fill no less than four tracks with excellent content.</p>
<p>So a big thanks and congratulations to all who decided to go. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re going to have one heck of a show.</p>
