<p>Jason Wong of ionami has <a href="http://www.jasonwong.org/articles/2005/07/12/and-now-the-world">announced</a> that they&#8217;ve just launched <a href="http://www.epsondevelopers.com/">epsondevelopers.com</a> for <span class="caps">EPSON</span> on a Rails platform:</p>
<blockquote>ionami has been working with <span class="caps">EPSON</span> for over 3 years. While we created the original <span class="caps">EPSON</span> Developers site in Java, they were surprisingly open to a switch. We sold them on maintainability, speed, and the lower overall cost. We took the opportunity to do a redesign, and move the original, public site to Rails for ease of management.</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s great news! Landing <span class="caps">EPSON</span> with Rails development is definitely a great step in that elusive &#8220;corporate&#8221; direction. At the same time, ionami has announced they&#8217;re going to do all future developments using Ruby on Rails. They&#8217;re officially a &#8220;Rails Shop&#8221; now.</p>
