<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">JetBrains&#8217; IntelliJ</a> has long been the gold standard for Java IDEs. Now the company is taking a shot at turning their suite into a good fit for Ruby and Rails development. This new love is coming in the form of a <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/ruby_development.html">new official Ruby plug-in</a>.</p>
<p>It features assisted Ruby coding, with keyword completion, syntax highlighting, on-the-fly code validation, error highlighting, and Rails templates and generator integration. They even put together a <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/training/demos/ruby.html">screencast</a> to show it off.</p>
<p>Cool stuff. Especially if you already plugged down $400 for a license or work on an open-source project (free license, then).</p>
