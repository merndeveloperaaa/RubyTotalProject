<p>While we&#8217;re working on bringing it back, you can get <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/backups/rails-html-2005-09-20-16-09.zip">the <span class="caps">HTML</span> backup</a> (2.6MB). The homepage for that export is broken, but the rest should be good.</p>
<p>Madeleine is so stretched beyond breaking point for handling a wiki the size of the Rails one. Ugh.</p>
