<p>We suspected a pattern was emerging as IBM&#8217;s Sam Ruby first <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/41715395@N00/31541062/">at <span class="caps">OSCON</span> reenacted</a> the <a href="http://rubyonrael.com/">original joke from etech</a>, then posted about the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/08/09/Rails-Confidence-Builder">Rails Confidence Builder</a>, and finally <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/08/25/Acts-As-Tree">combined that work with Atom</a> using acts_as_tree. Yes, something was in the cards.</p>
<p>And Sam has now played another power-hand in favor of Ruby on Rails:</p>
<blockquote>Next month, I will be presenting at <a href="http://www.fosssl.org/"><span class="caps">FOSSSL</span> &#8217;05</a> in Colombo, Sri Lanka; first a keynote on Friday entitled The Case for Dynamic Languages, then a tutorial on Saturday entitled Riding Ruby-On-Rails.</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s awesome! If I didn&#8217;t say it earlier, let me repeat: Welcome to the party, Sam. It&#8217;s great to have you here. We&#8217;re honored. Now just one tiny nitpick: &#8220;Ruby on Rails&#8221;, not &#8220;Ruby-On-Rails&#8221; :)</p>
