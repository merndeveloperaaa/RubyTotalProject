We're happy to announce Rails 5.1.0.rc2 has been released. We are now really close to the final release.
We still have a [few open issues in the milestone](https://github.com/rails/rails/milestone/49) but we are
still expecting to be able to do the final release during the Railsconf 2017.

While we are working to close the last issues, you can check [the Rails 5.1 releases notes](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/5_1_release_notes.html),
or the awesome summary of new features present in [the 5.1.0.beta1 blog post](https://rubyonrails.org/2017/2/23/Rails-5-1-beta1).

As per our [maintenance policy][maintenance-policy], the release of Rails 5.1 will mean that bug fixes will only apply
to 5.1.x, regular security issues to 5.1.x and 5.0.x, and severe security issues to 5.1.x, 5.0.x, and 4.2.x.
This means 4.x and below will essentially be unsupported!

To try out this new release:

```
gem install rails -v 5.1.0.rc2
```

Make sure you are using RubyGems 2.6.11 or later before trying to install a pre release, with:

```
gem update --system 2.6.11
```

Please help us test this release candidate version of Rails. It's always frustrating when we put a lot of work into a
new release, betas, release candidates, and then get people report all sorts of issues on week one of the final release.
This is an incremental upgrade to Rails 5.0. Please do your community duty and help us land a solid 5.1 without needing
an immediate 5.1.1.

Thank you!
