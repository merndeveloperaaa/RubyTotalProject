Hey folks!  I've pushed 3.0.8.rc2. 

I want to give a big thanks to Philip Arndt and Robert Pankowecki for reporting regressions in 3.0.8.rc1!  We've fixed the regressions, so I pushed an rc2.

To see the diffs for this rc, check out [the commit list on github](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.8.rc1...v3.0.8.rc2).

Since we've released a new release candidate, I'll target the final release for June 1.  If you find regressions between v3.0.7 and v3.0.8.rc2, please let me know and we'll do another rc!

Thanks everyone!
