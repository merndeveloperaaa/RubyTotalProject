<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ <span class="caps">IDEA</span></a> has long been regarded as one of the best IDEs for Java development. With the 7.0 release they&#8217;ve followed Netbeans and Eclipse by offering <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/ruby_rails.html">significant support for Ruby on Rails</a> alongside the Java tooling. They have a neat <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/training/demos/rails.html">video tutorial showing off the Rails features</a>.</p>
