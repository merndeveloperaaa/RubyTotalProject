<p>Last year&#8217;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">O&#8217;Reilly Open Source Convention</a> was a watershed event for Ruby outside of Japan.  Ruby was the well-deserved buzz of the conference.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/create/e_sess/">call for participation</a> is closing late Sunday night.  If you&#8217;ve got something to teach, head on over and drop your Ruby and/or Rails proposal into the hat.</p>
