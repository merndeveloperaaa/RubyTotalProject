<p>Hank Roar is the customer on a project being developed by ThoughtWorker Obie. He&#8217;s quite <a href="http://hhroark.blogspot.com/2005/04/time-to-learn-ruby-and-rails.html">pleased with the progress</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Never under estimate the importance of allowing developers to use the tools they love. I don&#8217;t personally know Obie well, but I think he feels passionate about Ruby and Rails. This, coupled with the fact that the simulators will not go to my ultimate users, has resulted in the simulators being fun to use, not just simple data entry forms. The executive sponsor was very impressed with the simulator. I think the sponsor really enjoyed how much fun it was to use.</blockquote>
