<p>Justin French have survived the first week on his <a href="http://justinfrench.com/index.php?id=91">transitionary journey</a> from <span class="caps">PHP</span> to Rails. I have special sympathy for refugees from that camp as I used to do a lot of <span class="caps">PHP</span> myself not too long ago. Justin sums up his experience with:</p>
<blockquote>I also think that a Rails developer is inherently a &ldquo;better&rdquo; programmer by force. <span class="caps">PHP</span> makes it very easy for anyone (myself included) to slap together some poorly planned procedural code and claim the title of &ldquo;<span class="caps">PHP</span> Web Application Developer&rdquo;. Rails on the other hand at least tries to make us better programmers by default.</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly possible to write <span class="caps">PHP</span> that doesn&#8217;t succumb to the draw of becoming a big ball of mud, but the structure is completely self-imposed. Easy to slip if you&#8217;re not careful.</p>
<p>Seems like Justin has quite a following of <a href="http://justinfrench.com/?id=90">other PHP&#8217;ers curious about Rails</a>, so its great to see that he&#8217;s continuing to blog the transition and hopefully instill others with the courage to do the same.</p>
