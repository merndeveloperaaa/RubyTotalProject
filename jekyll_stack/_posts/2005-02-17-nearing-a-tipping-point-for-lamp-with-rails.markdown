<p>Tom Purl believes we&#8217;re getting near a <a href="http://www.tompurl.com/?p=3">tipping point for <span class="caps">LAMP</span> in the enterprise</a> and that the missing piece, &#8220;&#8230;this bridge appears to be Ruby on Rails&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote>So in addition to being able to use <span class="caps">LAMP</span> and increased productivity, why would large companies wan to use Ruby on Rails? Well, for starters, large companies are already using the <span class="caps">MVC</span> framework extensively with J2EE and .Net, so another slightly-different framework wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to swallow. Also, Ruby is is an object-oriented scripting language that shares many features with Java an C#. It certainly has its differences, but nothing compared to the differences between Cobol and Java or VB 6.</blockquote>
