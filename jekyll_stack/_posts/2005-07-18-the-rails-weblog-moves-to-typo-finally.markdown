<p><img src="http://typo.leetsoft.com/files/5t.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px" />When we originally launched rubyonrails.org, none of the Rails-based blogging engines were really up to the task of running the show. But with the appearance of <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/">Typo</a> and it&#8217;s massive uptake and rapid improvement, we have a very viable solution now. So goodbye, WordPress! You served us in a crunch, but I&#8217;m also very pleased to see you go.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.lighttpd.net/light_logo.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px" />The switch means that we&#8217;ll actually be able to keep comments open without the blogging engine mysteriously shutting them off. And that we&#8217;ll hopefully be even better equipped to combat spam.</p>
<p>Thanks once more to <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/">Tobias Luekte</a> for blessing the world of Rails blogging with Typo.</p>
<p>And thanks to Jan and the rest of the lighttpd team for creating just a spiffy web server. We&#8217;re serving both this blog and <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.org">the manuals site</a> of <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net">lighttpd</a> now.</p>
