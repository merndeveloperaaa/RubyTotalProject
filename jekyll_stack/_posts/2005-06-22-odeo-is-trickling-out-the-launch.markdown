<p><a href="http://www.odeo.com/"><span class="caps">ODEO</span></a> is the upcoming premier portal for podcasting shows.

Phillip Torrone has a <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/06/odeo_minireview.html">mini-review</a> up on O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s Make magazine. Why is this Rails news?
