<p>Prototype 1.5 shipped together with Rails 1.2 today. But that&#8217;s not all that&#8217;s been happening at the JavaScript sugar mill. Today also marks the official unveiling of <a href="http://prototypejs.org">prototypejs.org</a>. A brand new site dedicated to promoting and teaching Prototype. It comes complete with <a href="http://prototypejs.org/api"><span class="caps">API</span> documentation</a>, <a href="http://prototypejs.org/blog">a blog</a>, and <a href="http://prototypejs.org/contribute">a guide on how to contribute</a>. Congratulations to Sam, Justin, and the rest of the team behind the site.</p>
