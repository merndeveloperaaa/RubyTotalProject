<p>If you&#8217;re in Chicago for <a href="http://railsconf.org/">RailsConf</a>, you might want to extend your stay to include the following Monday. <a href="https://workshop.37signals.com/">The Getting Real workshop by 37signals</a> is going down on June 26th. Learn all about how you can put those Rails skills towards your own business and build web applications like Basecamp, Backpack, and Campfire.</p>
<p>The workshop was announced yesterday and half the seats are already gone. If you want to partake, you&#8217;ll probably have to sign up pretty soon.</p>
