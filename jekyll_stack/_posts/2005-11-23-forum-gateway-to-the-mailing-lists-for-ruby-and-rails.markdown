<p>Andreas Schwarz has set up <a href="http://rforum.andreas-s.net/trac/">RForum</a> to play <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/">gateway to both Ruby and Rails</a>. So you can create an account on ruby-forum.com and be able to post to the mailing lists through that interface. Very nifty. RForum is also an open source Rails app.</p>
