<p><a href="http://reboot.dk/">Reboot 8</a> is happening on June 1st and 2nd in Copenhagen and the conference is looking for a handful of cool demos to play part in the conference. The organizers have asked me to encourage the Rails community to participate. So if you have a cool application, commercial or open source, that you&#8217;d like to show to the world, <a href="http://reboot.dk/wiki/Demo">checkout the Demo page on the Reboot wiki</a>.</p>
