We're proud to welcome [Eileen M. Uchitelle](https://github.com/eileencodes) to [Rails core](https://rubyonrails.org/community/#core). Eileen has worked tirelessly on Rails for three years, and just completed a major integration bit to have [Capybara-backed system tests in Rails 5.1](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/26703).

Her [fingerprints](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/eileen-m-uchitelle/commits) are all over Active Record, she's been reviewing tons of community pull requests, pushed testing ever forward, and written a bunch of needed documentation. A very well-rounded involvement indeed!

Eileen is Rails core member #14 and our first woman on the team ❤️🎉👏
