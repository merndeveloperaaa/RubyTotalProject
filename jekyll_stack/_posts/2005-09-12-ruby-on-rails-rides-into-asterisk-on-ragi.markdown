<p><a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> is the open-source <span class="caps">PBX</span> that makes the phone an interesting and hackable device again. But the UI is more than a little geeky, which is where <span class="caps">RAGI</span> comes in. It&#8217;s the <a href="http://ragi.sourceforge.net/">Ruby Asterisk Gateway Interface</a> that serves as a bridge between Ruby on Rails and Asterix. Their pitch goes:</p>
<blockquote><span class="caps">RAGI</span> eases the development of interactive automated telephony applications such as <span class="caps">IVR</span>, call routing, automated call center, and extended IP-<span class="caps">PBX</span> functionality by leveraging the productivity of the Ruby on Rails framework.  <span class="caps">RAGI</span> simplifies the process of creating rich telephony and web apps with a single common web application framework, object model and database backend.   <span class="caps">RAGI</span> is available under the <span class="caps">BSD</span> license.</blockquote>
<p>Pretty exciting stuff.</p>
