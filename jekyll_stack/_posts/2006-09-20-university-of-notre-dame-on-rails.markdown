<p>John Nunemaker wrote to tell me that the University of Notre Dame has picked up Ruby on Rails and is using it for <a href="http://forum.nd.edu/">their forum site</a>. About the implementation, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>The live webcast area is using rjs and such to capture live notes taken by viewers and update live photos from flickr without interrupting the stream of the video. The site takes advantage of Rails page caching and has a small admin area which updates the various sections of the site.</blockquote>
<p>Cool stuff! Have you seen Rails in use in academia elsewhere? Tell your story in the comments.</p>
