<p>Chicago is turning into the hotbed for web-application framework development with both a majority of the Rails and Django teams in town. So we thought we&#8217;d celebrate that with a happy gathering at DePaul University on December 3rd. For chats and talks on web development using Django and Rails.</p>
<p>In town? Checkout the <a href="http://snakesandrubies.com/event/">Snakes and Rubies site</a> for preloading questions and event info.</p>
