<p>The <a href="http://www.typogarden.com/">Typo theme contest</a> just got beefed up quite bit. <a href="http://www.site5.com/">Site 5</a> has offered a 15&quot; Powerbook for the wining theme and a 12&quot; iBook for number two. That&#8217;s on top of the truck load of other prices.</p>
<p>If you have any sliver of design skill in your bone, you&#8217;d be well advised to participate in this content. Oh, and the upshot is that Typo gets a legion of cool new themes out of it too. See, everybody wins!</p>
