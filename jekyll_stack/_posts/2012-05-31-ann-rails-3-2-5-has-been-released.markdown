Good news everyone!  Rails version 3.2.5 has been released.

This version of Rails is a less broken version of 3.2.4!

## What happened with 3.2.4?

A regression was reported in the release candidate.  I reverted that regression without releasing another release candidate for testing.  This release fixes the original regression along with the error made during reverting.

## CHANGES

This release only contains a few changes, mainly reverting bad commits.  Please check out the commit list [on github](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.2.4...v3.2.5).

Thanks to everyone, especially @pixeltrix and @rafaelfranca for putting up with me!
