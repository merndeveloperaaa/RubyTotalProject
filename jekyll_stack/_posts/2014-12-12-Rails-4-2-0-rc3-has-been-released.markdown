Happy Friday everyone!

The Rails team has just released [the third Release Candidate of Rails 4.2.0][gem]
today. For an overview of all the major changes in the 4.2 series, please refer
to the [release notes][release-notes].

The RC3 release includes a few more minor patches over RC2. You can refer to
[the diff on Github][commits] for a full list of changes.

We would like to thank you again for assisting our team in testing the release
candidates. Please continue to report any issues you discovered to our
[issue tracker][tracker] and/or notify the maintainers of the relevant gems and
plugins.

So far, we still haven't identify any major regressions for this release,
meaning that we are still on track for our target to release the final version
of 4.2.0 before Christmas time.
