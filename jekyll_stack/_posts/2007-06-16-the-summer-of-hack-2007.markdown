<p><a href="http://workingwithrails.com/hackfest">The hackfest is back</a>! In sleek new form, the &#8217;fest runs monthly, starting now.</p>
<p>Without further ado: <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/hackfest/12-monthly-june-2-7">it&#8217;s on</a>. Two weeks to go. Sprint!</p>
<p>Thanks to Working With Rails for making this an integral part of their site; thanks to O&#8217;Reilly for signing on as the <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/hackfest/sponsorship">first sponsor</a> (first prize is a free pass to RailsConf Europe); and thanks to you for contributing the patches and bugfixes that keep Rails at the top of its game.</p>
<p>Go, go!</p>
