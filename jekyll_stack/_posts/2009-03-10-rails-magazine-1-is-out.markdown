<p>One of the measures of the health of a development platform is its ability to support a vibrant ecosystem of users, contributors, speakers, and authors. By this measure, Rails remains in excellent shape. The latest evidence: the release of the first issue of <a href="http://railsmagazine.com/">Rails Magazine</a> &#8211; 36 pages of full-color glossy print.</p>
<p>The first issue includes 9 articles covering everything from delegation in Ruby to using Saasy for subscription-based applications to performance analysis and getting started with JRuby. The full content will be available on the web shortly, but if you&#8217;d like to support this effort (and help ensure that it doesn&#8217;t go away) you can <a href="http://magcloud.com/browse/Issue/7830">order a paper copy</a> for $8 in the US, UK, or Canada.</p>
