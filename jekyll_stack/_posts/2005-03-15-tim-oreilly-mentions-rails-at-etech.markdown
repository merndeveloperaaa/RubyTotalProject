<p>Tim O&#8217;Reilly opened the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">Emerging Technology</a> conference today with a talk on pattern remixes. Much to our delight, Tim choose to highlight Ruby on Rails during the talk. I don&#8217;t have much specifics outside of what few notes the blogosphere has jotted down, but <a href="http://softtechvc.blogs.com/software_only/2005/03/etech_tim_oreil.html">Jeff Clavier blogged the quote</a> as: &#8220;Ruby on Rails: being able to develop real-world applications with simple design and almost no code.&#8221; Not a bad summary.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re at ETech, don&#8217;t forget to check out Jason Fried&#8217;s presentation, which follows the form of <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000423.html">the one he gave a few days ago</a> with great success at <span class="caps">SXSW</span>.</p>
