<p>The <a href="http://railsconf.org/">first RailsConf</a> scheduled for June 22-25 in Chicago sold out so fast it made our heads spin. 550 seats were snatched up before the program was even ready or a week had passed. That left a lot of people from Europe and even the US without much of a chance to participate.</p>
<p>Here comes the remedy: <a href="http://europe.railsconf.org/">RailsConf Europe</a>. From September 14th to 15th, London will set the stage for the second official Ruby on Rails conference.</p>
<p>The program has yet to be finalized, but a good number of headliners have already been confirmed: Dave Thomas, Jamis Buck, Jim Weirich, and my favorite blogger and thinker on passion, Kathy Sierra. Marcel Molina, David A. Black, Chad Fowler, and yours truly are also lined up. A call for proposals should be going up shortly to fill in the rest.</p>
<p>Bringing over that many speakers from the US and putting them and the conference up in central London ain&#8217;t cheap, though. So the sticker might carry a bit of an initial shock. There&#8217;s a <b>super-early bird special of &pound;400</b> and the rates then travel from there to a just-before price of &pound;575.</p>
<p>But none of the speakers are taking home a dime and Chad Fowler has been working his ass off for free through RubyCentral, which is the non-profit organization putting on this show. They have in the past used profits from conferences to fund Ruby hackathons. So at least you know your quid isn&#8217;t being blown on white powdery rails. All the hype is 100% home-grown.</p>
<p>To the tune of that violin, let me just remind that as with RailsConf Chicago, there&#8217;re a limited number of seats. Roughly 500 spots. When they&#8217;re gone, they&#8217;re gone. If you want to go to an official Rails conference this year, meet and hear the core team among others speak, this is the last chance.</p>
<p>See you all in London in September!</p>
