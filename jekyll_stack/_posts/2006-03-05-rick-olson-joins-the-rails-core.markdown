<p><a href="http://techno-weenie.net/">Rick Olson</a> aka technoweenie has been granted the rank of core and will join the new 12-strong group of <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/core">developers with commit rights</a> to the Rails source.</p>
<p>Rick has long been a prominent figure in the Rails community with ton of <a href="http://techno-weenie.net/svn/projects/plugins/">great plugins</a> to his name, but it has been <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/search?q=rick+olson&amp;wiki=on&amp;changeset=on&amp;ticket=on">his work on Rails 1.1</a> that made us realize that he was an obvious fit.</p>
<p>From the upgraded calculations, to enumeration support for <span class="caps">RJS</span>, to his work on eager loading, and a ton of other minor issues, Rick has shown strong knowledge and ability across the code base. When Rails 1.1 is released shortly, you&#8217;ll be using a lot of Rick&#8217;s code.</p>
<p>So congratulations, Rick! You&#8217;ve joined the exclusive club of Rails core committers.</p>
