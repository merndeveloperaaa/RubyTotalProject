It's a privilege to welcome <a href="https://github.com/kaspth">Kasper Timm Hansen</a> to the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/community/#core">Rails core team</a>, and I'm not just saying that because he's a fellow Dane, though it helps 🇩🇰! Kasper started contributing to Rails during the 2013 Summer of Code program where he worked on the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11218">new Loofah-backed sanitizer</a>. It was a big job and Kasper aced it.

Since then he's racked up <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/kasper-timm-hansen/commits">almost seven hundred commits</a> on a wide variety of projects and PRs. He's helped countless contributors <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues?utf8=✓&q=commenter%3Akaspth%20">polish their pull requests</a> to the point that their work can be committed to the framework.

He's also continued making substantial, individual contributions, like the new partial collection <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18948">caching</a> <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/23695">scheme</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/20904">wildcard template dependencies</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19571">big improvements to the test runner</a>.

He joins the core team as lucky #13 😎✨👏
