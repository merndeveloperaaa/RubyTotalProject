<p>So, I first got in contact Josh Petersen back in late May of last year as he had been tracking the pre-release hype of Rails and was intrigued. That lead to a visit to Seattle in late June where I got a chance to hang with Erik, Daniel, and Josh for a few days to help them explore the idea, inject a (over?) dose of cocky Less Software mentality, and of course convince them that Ruby on Rails was exactly the platform they wanted to develop 43things on.</p>
<p>Over the following months, Josh and friends retained 37signals to work on the user interface, hired Ruby programmer Eric Hodel and three more guys to have a team of seven working on the company and their first Ruby on Rails application. I kept growing inspired by the idea behind 43things, the confidence shown by the Robots in Rails, and impatient to see the final result.</p>
<p>How fitting then, that the Robots would launch 43things on the first day of the new year. Just in time for you to enter all those New Year&#8217;s resolutions and committing to them in public. I&#8217;m already busy getting lost in the intensely intriguing world of desires. I could easily see one spending hours and hours and hours browsing the depths.</p>
<p>So there you have it. The second poster-app for Rails. Smashing! Huge congratulations to Ivan, Todd, Bob, Erik, Eric, Daniel, and Josh. You did it, guys. Can&#8217;t wait to see this thing skyrocket.</p>
