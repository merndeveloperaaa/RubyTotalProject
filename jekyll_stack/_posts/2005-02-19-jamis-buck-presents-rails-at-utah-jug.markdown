<p><a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/">Jamis Buck</a> did a presentation of Rails for the Utah Java Users Group two nights ago. He has made the <a href="http://ruby.jamisbuck.org/ujug-presentation/Ruby%20on%20Rails.html">entire show</a> available online including the Terminal videos used to show the programming. The presentation was given in between one about <span class="caps">JDO</span> and Howard Lewis Ship&#8217;s one about Tapestry. Here&#8217;s what one of the spectators noted:</p>
<blockquote>As a witness to the event, I have to say that the presentation went quite well. This is what I learned from each speaker:1) <span class="caps">JDO</span> is losing popularity to Hibernate, 2) How to build a entire <span class="caps">CRUD</span> app in 40 min using Rails, 3) How to build a single login screen in 1 hour using Tapestry. Hmmmm&#8230; kinda indicative of the tools presented. :)</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations on the good show, Jamis!</p>
