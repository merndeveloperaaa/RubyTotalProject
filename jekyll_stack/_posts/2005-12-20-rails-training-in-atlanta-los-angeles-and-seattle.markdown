<p>Marcel Molina&#8217;s <a href="http://bignerdranch.com/classes/ruby.shtml">Ruby on Rails Bootcamp</a> was a sell-out smash hit at the Big Nerd Ranch a while back, so they&#8217;ve reeled him back in for <a href="http://bignerdranch.com/about/rubyonrails0306pr.shtml">another show going March 6th through 10th</a>. Last time, Marcel even showed off lots of fancy new 1.1 features even before the official 1.0 release was dry. So you know its bound to be good next time as well.</p>
<p>But if Atlanta or a whole week isn&#8217;t your game, Geoffrey Grosenbach is doing a 3-day Rails training course in <a href="http://dvcreators.net/events/rubyonrails_seminar.php">Seattle on January 23rd</a> and <a href="http://dvcreators.net/events/rubyonrails.php">Los Angeles on January 30th</a>. Geoffrey is the man behind <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">the Rails Podcast</a>, <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/">Nuby on Rails</a>, and <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/pages/sparklines">the wonderful sparklines package</a>.</p>
