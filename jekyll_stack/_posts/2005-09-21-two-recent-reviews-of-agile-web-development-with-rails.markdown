<p>If you&#8217;re still unsure as to whether buying <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> is a good idea, these two reviews might convince you. Glen Swinfield <a href="http://www.glenswinfield.co.uk/learning-ruby-on-rails/ruby-on-rails-book-review/">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>After reading, probably 50% of the book, I&rsquo;m sold on the benefits of Ruby on Rails application building and I am considering using a Ruby on Rails approach in a few upcoming client projects. There are still things I can do faster with php, but this is a skills gap issue on my part &#8211; there is always a slow period when you first learn something new, and it&rsquo;s easy to just sack it and continue as you are, so it is important to keep making progess during these stages &#8211; this book will ensure that you do. Each new chapter teaches something new, significant and interesting, it is well written gets a 4.5 out of 5 from me. Excellent.</blockquote>
<p>Richard Monson-Haefel, an analyst with the Burton Group, <a href="http://rmh.blogs.com/weblog/2005/09/book_review_agi.html">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In my opinion, this is one of the best development books I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of reading in a long time. I found myself reading almost the entire book &#8211; which is unusual since I normally can&#8217;t get past a few pages in most technical books before labeling it crap and putting in the circular bin. (I do not donate those books to the library because I don&#8217;t want to encourage their distribution).</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, guys!</p>
