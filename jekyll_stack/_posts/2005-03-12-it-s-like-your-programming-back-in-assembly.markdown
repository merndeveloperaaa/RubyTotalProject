<p>Shanti A. Braford is <a href="http://sablog.com/archives/2005/03/14/on-programming-in-php-after-learning-ruby-on-rails">being forced back into <span class="caps">PHP</span></a> after getting jiggy with Ruby on Rails. He&#8217;s not liking it one bit:</p>
<blockquote>Programming a web application in <span class="caps">PHP</span> feels a lot like reinventing the wheel, after having learned Ruby on Rails&#8230; Welcome to the world of a Rails developer who has drunk the Kool-Aid but has gone back to the world of <span class="caps">PHP</span>. You&rsquo;re used to things just working so easily and intuitively, like magic almost, yet they don&rsquo;t anymore&#8230; It&rsquo;s like your programming back in Assembly after learning a high-level language like Java or something.</blockquote>
<p>With this level of discontent, I sure hope he has deeper reasons for going back than not wanting to make a Ebay WS wrapper (should hardly take more than a few hours, tops) and a responder to a <a href="http://php.amnuts.com/demos/crop-canvas/interactive.php"><span class="caps">DHTML</span> cropper</a> (<a href="http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/">RMagick</a> is wonderful).</p>
<p>Is the trade really worth it, Shanti?</p>
