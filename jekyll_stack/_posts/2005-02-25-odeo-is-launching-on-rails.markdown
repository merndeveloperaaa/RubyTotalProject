<p>Evan Williams (of Blogger fame) and friends have unveiled their latest venture: <a href="http://odeo.com/">Odeo</a>. It&#8217;s going to make &#8220;&#8230;it easy for you to discover, create, and subscribe to fresh, independent audio content for your iPod&#8221;. In short, Portal for Podcasting. That hook got <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/25/technology/25podcast.html&amp;OP=22c3274e/sV5LskQ26|8!Q26Q26yQ25sQ25Q5EQ5EAsQ5EQ25sQ25Asy5|@.Q26PQ26Q5BzsQ25ANQ26k|G8yQ3F@yQ5CP">the interest of The New York Times</a>, but to get the full story, you&#8217;ll be well advised to read <a href="http://www.evhead.com/2005/02/how-odeo-happened.asp">Evan&#8217;s blog posting</a> about it and <a href="http://odeo.com/blog/">the Odeo blog</a> in general.</p>
<p>I had a sneak peak at the application a few days ago and it looks mighty cool. I&#8217;m a big fan of podcasting myself (especially from the ever excellent <a href="http://www.itconversations.com">ITConversations</a>), so the prospect of Odeo makes me pretty excited.</p>
<p>What also makes me excited is Odeo running Ruby on Rails. Remember that posting <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000367.html">Evhead advertises for a Rails developer</a> back in the beginning of December? That resulted in the hiring of <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/111541">Rabble</a> as the lead developer on Odeo. He <a href="http://www.anarchogeek.com/archives/000494.html">talks about the Odeo launch</a> and how they &#8220;&#8230;built it with the wonderful Ruby on Rails framework&#8221; in his blog.</p>
<p>So congratulations, guys! It&#8217;s great to see another high-profile site launch on Rails and loving it. Keep &#8217;em coming.</p>
