<p>How fitting. Just as we&#8217;re wrapping up Rails 1.2, the book that covers it all has gone into print. I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails2/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails, 2nd Edition</a>, of course. The book that has taught the vast majority of all Rails developers the ropes.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, it&#8217;ll be available in all its paper glory around December 15th. But you can actually get the final <span class="caps">PDF</span> now. Dave Thomas just released the same version as was shipped off to the printers. If you&#8217;d like to get access to the information now, but still enjoy reading long sections from paper, there&#8217;s the combo pack.</p>
<p>The timing is great and so are the sections on <span class="caps">RJS</span>, migrations, resources, respond_to, polymorphic associations, and all the other new-fangled wonders that has been introduced to Rails since the last version of the book. Go get it.</p>
