<p>The latest version of <a href="http://mephistoblog.com">Mephisto</a>, the blog that powers Riding Rails, has been released.  Justin Palmer has <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/2006/8/31/mephisto-immortus-released">the nitty gritty details</a> at the Mephisto Blog.  Our focus for this release has been the simple Asset Manager, as shown in the screenshot.  I feel it&#8217;s pretty solid for a blog, so future releases will focus on broadening the horizons with some more <span class="caps">CMS</span> capabilities.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re not looking for a publishing tool now, there&#8217;s a wealth of good, unit tested code in the <a href="http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/mephisto/trunk/">subversion repository</a>.</p>
