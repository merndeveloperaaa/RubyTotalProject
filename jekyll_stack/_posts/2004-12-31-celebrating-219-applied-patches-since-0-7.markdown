<p>Rails has absorbed <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/report/5">~219 patches</a> since the ticketing went Trac around the release of Rails 0.7. That&#8217;s almost <em>three patches applied per day</em>. Quite the barn raising. Seems like we&#8217;re keeping the pace too with more than 20 patches awaiting to be applied from over the last week. And I even did apply a few. And some of these &#8220;patches&#8221; are huge things like a DB2 and a finished <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server adapter.</p>
<p>The open source is working.</p>
