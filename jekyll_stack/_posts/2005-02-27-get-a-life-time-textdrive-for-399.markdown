<p><a href="http://textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a> is our wonderful host. They&#8217;re contributing big time to the development of Rails and are up to date with the latest (like exploring <a href="http://weblog.textdrive.com/article/32/textdrive-loves-lighttpd">lighttpd as an Apache alternative</a>). They&#8217;ve won the heart of many big-time Railers, like the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a>, <a href="http://scott.elitists.net/">Scott Barron</a>, <a href="http://www.standardbehaviour.com/log/index">Marten Veldthuis</a>, and many others.</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;re offering you a limited opportunity of a <i>life-time</i> account for just $399. The drive is called <a href="http://textdrive.com/vctwo">VC II</a> and is a very interesting way to allow users to expand the company&#8217;s ambitions by getting something in return and keeping foreign capitals (and the onslaught of strings attached) out.</p>
<p>Better be quick, though. The last drive they did sold out in no time fast.</p>
