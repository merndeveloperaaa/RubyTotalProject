<p>LiteSpeed Web Server is a commercial product that offers a free version for private and commercial use. With release 2.2, <a href="http://www.litespeedtech.com">LiteSpeed Technologies</a> has embraced the Rails community and provided built-in support for deploying Rails Applications.</p>
<p>According to their website, they are &#8220;the world&#8217;s best performing Ruby <span class="caps">SAPI</span> and easiest Ruby on Rails application setup&#8221;.  I put their claims to a test in a couple of <a href="http://i.nfectio.us/articles/2006/09/04/litespeed-web-server-2-2-includes-rails-support">screencasts</a> for your viewing pleasure.</p>
