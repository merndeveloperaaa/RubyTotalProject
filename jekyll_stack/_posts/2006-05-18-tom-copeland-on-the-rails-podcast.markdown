<p>The latest <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">Rails podcast</a> features <a href="http://tomcopeland.blogs.com/">Tom Copeland</a>, one of the guys who generously runs <a href="http://rubyforge.org/">RubyForge</a>. Some might be surprised to know that <a href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/">Rich Kilmer</a> and Tom Copeland have been running RubyForge out of Rich&#8217;s basement for the past few years.</p>
<p>Aside from keeping all our Ruby libraries available for download, Rich and Tom have  been putting in a lot of work on their latest application, <a href="http://www.getindi.com/">indi</a> which is in  a private beta until mid summer.</p>
