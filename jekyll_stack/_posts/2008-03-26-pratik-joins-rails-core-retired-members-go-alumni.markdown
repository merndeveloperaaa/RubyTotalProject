<p><img src="/assets/2008/3/26/pratik.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; border: 1px solid black;" />We&#8217;re shaking up <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/core">the Rails core group</a> a bit. First, please welcome <a href="http://m.onkey.org/">Pratik Naik</a> as the newest member of the group.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been doing great work all around the framework and has been spearheading both the documentation branch in git and a thorough cleanup of Action View internals. We&#8217;re really happy to hand him the commit keys to the repository.</p>
<p>Second, we&#8217;ve created <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/core-alumni">the Rails core alumni</a> for all the proud members of the core group who are no longer in the day-to-day improvement of the framework itself. All of the alumni are still busy working in the Ruby on Rails ecosystem, but either have their hands full with their business or has dedicated their open source time to other initiatives.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re incredibly grateful for all the works you guys have done for Ruby on Rails over the years. And you&#8217;re all welcome back in the active core group any time you decide. Thanks guys!</p>
<p>Finally, this means that the current active core group is about half its former size. We&#8217;d like to add a few more to that, so hopefully we can pick a few more people who&#8217;ve been doing varied work on the framework for a sustained period of time soon.</p>
