<p>So what&#8217;s Duane Gran to do? He clearly has the hots for Ruby on Rails:</p>
<blockquote>If your group develops web-based applications, you need to know about Ruby on Rails. It isn&#8217;t magic, but spend a day with it and you will probably agree that it is the closest thing to magic you&#8217;ve seen in IT in the last few years. If this sounds like a lot of bravado, it is, but mine is just one of many voices in the crowd praising Ruby on Rails. Elegant and robust systems are built with Rails in a fraction of the time spent on previous platforms.</blockquote>
<p>But how can you translate that into changing the programming language and platform for your company? That&#8217;s what his post <a href="http://codesnipers.com/?q=node/30">A guide for changing programming languages</a> is all about. The arguments and approach that he and <a href="http://www.lucenebook.com/blog/">Erik Hatcher</a> used to their shop around from using Java to going with Ruby on Rails.</p>
