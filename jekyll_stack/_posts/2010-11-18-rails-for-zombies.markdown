<p>This morning my team over at Envy Labs <a href="http://blog.envylabs.com/2010/11/rails-for-zombies-released/" title="Rails for Zombies Released!">released</a> a free online tutorial called <a href="http://railsforzombies.org">Rails for Zombies</a>.  The website combines screencasts with in-browser coding to provide an interactive learning experience teaching the basics of Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p><a href="http://railsforzombies.org" title="Rails for Zombies"><img src="/assets/2010/11/18/Rails_for_Zombies-1.jpg" alt="Rails for Zombies" style="float:right; margin:0 0 5px 5px;border:none;" /></a></p>
<p>Learning Rails for the first time should be fun, and <a href="http://railsforzombies.org">Rails for Zombies</a> allows you to get your feet wet without any setup or configuration.  At the moment the application has five episodes.  Each episode consists of a single screencast followed by a group of exercises which must be completed before moving forward.  Once you complete all the labs, you unlock a hidden video which shows you where to go to continue your Rails learning.</p>
<p>If you have any friends who need to get started with Rails, hopefully this will help.</p>
