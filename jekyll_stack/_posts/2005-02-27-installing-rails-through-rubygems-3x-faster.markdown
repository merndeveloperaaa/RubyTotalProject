<p>RubGems 0.8.5 has <a href="http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=2474">been released</a> and turbo-charges the installation of new gems and updating of the repository lists. In general, it&#8217;s about three times faster than the old version. All you have to do to update is:</p>
<pre><code>
gem install rubygems-update
update_rubygems
</code></pre>
