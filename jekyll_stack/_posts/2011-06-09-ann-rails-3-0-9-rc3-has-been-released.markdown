I've pushed an rc3.  Yes, we skipped one.  I screwed up the rc2, so I yanked it, and we're going straight to rc3.  Good thing it's just a release candidate, right?  ;-)

As usual, please test this against your application and report any regressions to the [rails core mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core).  I would like to hear your feedback, good or bad.

I will release the final in 72hours if there are no reported regressions.  If there are reported regressions, I will release another RC and the clock will start over.

## CHANGES

Here are some of the major changes since 3.0.9.rc1:

* `escape_javascript` safebuffer fixes
* `json_escape` safebuffer fixes
* RDoc / ruby-debug conflict fixes.

For an exaustive list, please check out the commits on [github](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.9.rc1...v3.0.9.rc3).
