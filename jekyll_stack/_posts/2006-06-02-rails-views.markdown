<p><a href="http://codefluency.com">Bruce Williams</a> has started a new article series he calls <a href="http://codefluency.com/articles/2006/05/27/introducing-rails-views">Rails Views</a>.  Bruce is a long-time Rubyist and Rails early adopter and is the UI lead on development of a very large and complex Rails system.  If it&#8217;s Rails and UI-related, Bruce is the man.</p>
