<p><a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/articles/2006/06/01/will-work-for-money">Josh Susser</a> has just announced that he is available for hire. Though relatively new on the Rails scene, Josh has proved a fast learner and has made his mark with several valuable contributions to the community. Just the other day we added him as an author to this very blog. Take a look at his posts over on his personal <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/">blog</a> and if he looks like a good fit get in touch with him: josh at hasmanythrough com.</p>
