<p>Stefan Kaes has been untiringly pushing for optimizations of Rails. Since the release of Rails 0.12.1, Stefan has lead an effort that made his own sample application no less than <b>4 times faster</b> with Rails 0.14.&#215;. Pretty impressive stuff.</p>
<p>Now he&#8217;s blogging about Rails performance in general at <a href="http://railsexpress.de/blog/">RailsExpress.blog</a>. So be sure to subscribe to that feed if you care about a faster Rails. He already has suggestions and benchmarks up on sessions and pagination.</p>
