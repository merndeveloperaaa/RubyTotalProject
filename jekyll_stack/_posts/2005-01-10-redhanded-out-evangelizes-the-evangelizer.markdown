<p><img src="http://redhanded.hobix.com/images/redhanded-duck.gif" align="right"> I thought I was on with my game of spotting every Rails praise around the net and reposting it here in the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/category/praise/">praise category</a>, but apparently I need to be faster.</p>
<p><a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/">RedHanded</a>, that wonderful blog by Ruby&#8217;s number one comedian/mind-bender, has just out-evangelized the evangelizer by <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/railz0r3d.html">scooping two great praises</a> from Antonio Canigiano and Jason Perkins. Darn it, _wHY! :)</p>
