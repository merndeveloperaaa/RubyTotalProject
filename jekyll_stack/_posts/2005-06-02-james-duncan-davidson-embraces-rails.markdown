<p><a href="http://blog.x180.net/">James Duncan Davidson</a> and <a href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom">Mike Clark</a> have been working together on a commercial Rails project for a few weeks now. And while Mike has long been <a href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2005/05/22#RapidFeedback">singing the</a> <a href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2005/05/07#TestingChapter">praises of</a> Rails (much appreciated!), I&#8217;ve been quite curious to hear James&#8217; thoughts. I&#8217;m very flattered on behalf of the Rails team to quote the following:</p>
<blockquote>Rails is the most well thought-out web development framework I&#8217;ve ever used. And that&#8217;s in a decade of doing web applications for a living. I&#8217;ve built my own frameworks, helped develop the Servlet <span class="caps">API</span>, and have created more than a few web servers from scratch. Nobody has done it like this before.</blockquote>
<p>He <a href="http://blog.x180.net/2005/06/rails_a_few_wee.html#more">goes on to talk</a> about how Rails is of course not perfect, but that he really likes the Convention over Configuration and says &#8220;&#8230;if I never see another damn <span class="caps">XML</span> configuration file in my life, I&#8217;d be happy as a pig in mud&#8221;.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see how all these great Java minds are going to unleash their ideas on the platform. There&#8217;s a melting pot brewing with the influx of programmers coming from <span class="caps">PHP</span>, Java, .<span class="caps">NET</span>, and other environments as well as all the designers picking it. Great things in the making.</p>
