<p>It seemed to have slipped all of our minds, but yesterday, the 25th of July marks the 2 year anniversary of Rails&#8217; release.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s David&#8217;s <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/107370">announcement email to the ruby-talk mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers to you early adopters.</p>
