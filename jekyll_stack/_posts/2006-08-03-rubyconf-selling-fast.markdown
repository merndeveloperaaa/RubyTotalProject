Registration for [RubyConf 2006](http://www.rubycentral.org/conference) is **closed**. It took only about four hours to fill 200-some seats. Is that some kind of record?

If you missed out, consider holding your own. Ruby Central is offering [grants to help fund regional events](http://www.rubycentral.org/rcg2006.pdf).
