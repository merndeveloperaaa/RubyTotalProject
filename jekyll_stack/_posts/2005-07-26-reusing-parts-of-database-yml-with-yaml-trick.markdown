<p>The RedHanded _why features <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/yamlSMergeKey.html">a neat <span class="caps">YAML</span> trick</a> today that lets you reuse parts of the database.yml configuration file. So instead of specifying the same login over in all three environments, you just do it once and merge. Nifty!</p>
