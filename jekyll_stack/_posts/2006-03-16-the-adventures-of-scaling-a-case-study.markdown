<p><a href="http://poocs.net">Patrick Lenz</a> has started in on a case study <a href="http://poocs.net/articles/2006/03/13/the-adventures-of-scaling-stage-1">The adventures of scaling</a>, in four instalments, on how he made <a href="http://eins.de">eins.de</a> scale, improving its performance by about 60%.</p>
<p>The online community site was ported from 50,000 lines of <span class="caps">PHP</span> to 5,000 lines of Rails. It serves up over 1 million dynamic page impressions on a &#8220;good day&#8221;. This first instalment goes through their unsuitable initial setup and explains why it didn&#8217;t work, including a diagram of their configuration. As one of the article&#8217;s commenters says, &#8220;Nothing beats a shiny chart&#8221;. Looks promising. Good start. Thanks for the write up Patrick. Stay tuned.</p>
