<p><a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2005/08/05/introducing-switchtower">SwitchTower</a> author <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/">Jamis Buck</a> has provided an <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17">excellent manual</a> documenting how to use it. Those who&#8217;ve taken the plunge are loving how easy it makes deployment, as well as myriad other tasks. But I&#8217;m still always hearing, &#8220;We haven&#8217;t setup SwitchTower yet but are really looking forward to&#8221;.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://railsmachine.com">Rails Machine</a>. It sets out to lower the barrier to using SwitchTower by taking care of all the setup and maintenance. They are scheduling to open their doors in April. For now take a look at the <a href="http://railsmachine.com/screencasts/RailsMachineIntro.mov">short movie</a> they&#8217;ve made showing how easy they&#8217;ve made it for you to get going with SwitchTower. They get you up and running in under 5 minutes. No more excuse to not realize how much you love SwitchTower.</p>
