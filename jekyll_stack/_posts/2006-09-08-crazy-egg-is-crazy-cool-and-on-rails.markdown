<p><img src="/assets/2006/9/8/bc_heat.png" border="0" align="right" style="display: margin-left: 10px" /><a href="https://crazyegg.com/">Crazy Egg</a> lets you find out which links are popular on your page and presents the information in easy-to-understand heat maps. It&#8217;s incredibly well designed and a fantastic idea.</p>
<p>At 37signals, we&#8217;ve already picked up on a few themes of usage that&#8217;ll change the design on some of our signup pages.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots to love about Crazy Egg. They don&#8217;t call their initial release Beta, they dare charge real money for their product, and they offer a very simple product that&#8217;s just really darn useful.</p>
<p>Oh, and it&#8217;s all done with Rails. Crazy. Egg!</p>
