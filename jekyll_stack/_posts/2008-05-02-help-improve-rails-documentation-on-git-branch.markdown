<p>Pratik&#8217;s documentation branch for Rails has moved to <a href="http://github.com/lifo/docrails">http://github.com/lifo/docrails</a>. This branch is open for all to contribute to directly. Just send Pratik a note on Github asking for access and it shall be granted. There&#8217;s even a page for <a href="http://github.com/lifo/docrails/wikis">the conventions used on the branch</a>.</p>
<p>This makes it easier than ever to help improve the documentation for Rails and harder than ever to just sit back and whine about it. Make something great!</p>
