<p>The seven robots at the <a href="http://www.robotcoop.com">co-op</a> just had their upcoming Rails application <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002131468_btinterface27.html">43things featured in The Seattle Times</a>. Perhaps the characterization of the application isn&#8217;t as spot on as could be, but who can deny a mainstream mentioning of a major Rails application in the works? We sure can&#8217;t. Congratulations to Josh for making the mug shot and to the entire team for a bit of early recognition.</p>
