<p>Tim O&#8217;Reilly recently did a piece called &#8220;What&#8217;s on Tim&#8217;s Radar?&#8221;. It features a handful of concepts and software that Tim O&#8217;Reilly believes to be &#8220;&#8230;innovative, world-changing, or just plain cool&#8221;. Guess what&#8217;s in that fine bunch? Ruby on Rails!</p>

<p>The quote:</p>
<blockquote>Ruby On Rails: A framework, based on the Ruby programming language for rapid Web development, makes it easier than ever to build a site that draws on a big database. Presto: instant Amazons and eBays!</blockquote>
