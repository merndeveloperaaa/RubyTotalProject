Hello Everyone!

This is [Vipul](https://twitter.com/vipulnsward) from Pune, where it's the [Gudi-Padwa – or the Marathi New Year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudi_Padwa)!
Surrounded by garlands of [sweets](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/Gathi-A-sweet-way-to-say-Happy-Holi/articleshow/19135712.cms), lets head on to see, whats exciting this week.

_P.S. Happy New Year!_  
_P.P.S. Isn't it a New Year, everyday somewhere around the World?_

## Featured

### [This week's Rails contributors](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/this-week)

36 people contributed to make Rails awesome this week. If you haven't already, go ahead and watch [Rails on GitHub](https://github.com/rails/rails/watchers) to follow the discussions and find your first opprtunity to help out!

### [Rails 4.2.1 and 4.1.10 have been released!](https://rubyonrails.org/2015/3/19/Rails-4-2-1-and-4-1-10-have-been-released)

After four release candidates, Rails 4.2.1 and 4.1.10 have finally been released! Thanks to all the contributors, for tons of fixes. Check out the full changes for [4.2.1](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1) and [4.1.10](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v4.1.9...v4.1.10) respectively.

## New Stuff

### [`bin/rails test` runner](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19216)

A new test runner – `bin/rails test` – has landed on master. This is the successor to the rake-based test runner, and includes a few rspec-inspired features that are not part of minitest, like running by line number, rerun snippets, or logs displayed with unicorns filled with rainbow colors.

### [Added `rake initializers`](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19323)

Need to see all those initializers scattered in you application? Worry no more. Just run `rake initializers`! Did I mention they are sorted?

## Improved

### [Use fullpath from Rack request](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/0755d300170d1ef2f6d78f76d0126e962167be5a)

In Rack, `request#fullpath` returns the full path including the query string. This change uses `fullpath` from rack to avoid doing the same thing again in Rails. As a result, we also reduced some object allocations!

## Fixed

### [Materialize subqueries by adding `DISTINCT` to suport MySQL 5.7.6+](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19359)

In MySQL 5.7.6+, the default value for `optimizer_switch` has changed to `derived_merge=on`, which causes some issue with the subqueries generated by Rails. This change fixes that by adding a `DISTINCT` to the subqueries.

### [Don't cast nil to string in postgres enums](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/1e6afa40209ca15aee811bb5797c175c0d8eaad4)

Previously, `nil` values in PostgreSQL enums were casted to an empty string, which causes an error somewhere down the chain. But worry no more – this has now been fixed!
