<p>While Ruby is usually praised as being one of the most readable programming languages around, it&#8217;s certainly also possibly to make it obfuscated. It just takes a good dose of dedication to cause. And if that kind of dedication is flowing through your veins, consider signing up of the <a href="http://iorcc.blogspot.com/">Obfuscated Ruby Code Contest</a>. A competition on doing something useful with unreadable code and to win prices in the process.</p>
