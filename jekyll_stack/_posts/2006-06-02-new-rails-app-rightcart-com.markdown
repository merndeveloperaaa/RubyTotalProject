Back in January I took the [Pragmatic Rails Studio](http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails) along with some guys named Dylan Stamat and Jonathan Siegel. Earlier this week they announced a brand new internet application: [RightCart.com](http://rightcart.com). By the way, the two of them wrote it in Ruby on Rails in just six weeks!

RightCart is "Shopping 2.0". It lets you embed a shopping cart on any web page with just **three lines** of HTML and JavaScript. The RightCart service manages your customer's shopping cart contents for you, so integrating shopping capabilities into your website is trivial. They take care of everything from your catalog to payment processing. You can sell your own stuff and pay them a small percentage. You can also sell stuff from a shared catalog (with over a million items already) and get a 1% commission on the sale.

And like all good Web 2.0 companies, RightCart has a blog ([State of the Cart](http://rightcartblog.com)) to share news about their business and services.

Congratulations to Dylan and Jonathan on their product launch!
