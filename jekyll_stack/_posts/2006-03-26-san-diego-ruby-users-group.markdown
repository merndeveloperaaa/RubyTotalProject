<p>There is some action down in San Diego on the Ruby and Rails front. The local <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/03/25/san-diego-ruby-users-group-revival"><span class="caps">RUG</span></a>, after some time of inactivity, is revving back up. If you live in the area and are keen on meeting up with like minded Rubyists and Railers, take a look over at <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/">Kevin Clark&#8217;s</a> blog for more <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/03/25/san-diego-ruby-users-group-revival">information</a>.</p>
