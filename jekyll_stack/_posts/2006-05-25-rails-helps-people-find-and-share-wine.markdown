<p><a href="http://www.hivelogic.com/">Dan Benjamin</a>, the man who brought <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> to Rails, has teamed up with web-standards guru <a href="http://simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm</a> and launched <a href="http://www.corkd.com/">Cork&#8217;d</a>, a free service for wine fans.</p>
<p>Built with Rails, Cork&#8217;d lets you rate, review, and catalog the wines you&#8217;ve tried. You can also keep track of wines you&#8217;d like to try and buy easily. Best of all, the site has a nice social network aspect to it, where members are encouraged to share and subscribe to each others&#8217; reviews and recommendations.</p>
