## New

### [Add default option to belongs\_to](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28453)

The _:default_ option adds a _before\_validation_ callback that initializes the association with the given lambdaâ€™s return value:  
_belongs\_to :person, default: -\> {â€‹ Current.person }â€‹_

### [Add support to duplicable Rational and Complex](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28544)

This is a work ahead of the upcoming [Ruby changes](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/31ef3124a9db534abcc3e323f5d3cb696eda3bf5).

## Fixed

### [Allow Time#to\_time on frozen objects](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28147)

This fixes an issue with frozen that has been around since Rails 4.

### [Allow order to be given expressions as hash keys](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28191)

The Active Record _order_ method is no longer restricted to attribute names. It now accepts expressions like:  
_Post.order("LENGTH(title)" =\> :asc).last_

There were many other great [pull requests](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/master@%7B2017-03-12%7D...@%7B2017-03-24%7D) this week from [45 contributors](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20170312-20170324), including 8 first-timers. Thank you all!

Until next week!
