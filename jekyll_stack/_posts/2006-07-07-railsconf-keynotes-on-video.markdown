If you missed [RailsConf 2006](http://www.railsconf.org), you'll be glad to know that videos of the keynote presentations are being made available for online viewing and (coming soon) download. A collection of slides synchronized with recorded audio for all presentations will also be available soon. Videos and information about audio and slides can be found at [ScribeMedia](http://blog.scribestudio.com) at the [RailsConf 2006 Keynote Series](http://blog.scribestudio.com/pages/rails) page.

The first two keynotes by [Dave Thomas](http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/06/30/railsconf-2006-keynote-series-dave-thomas) and [Martin Fowler](http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/07/03/martin-fowler-railsconf-2006-keynote-address) are already available. The other five will trickle out over the next few weeks. Next up, David Heinemeier Hansson's keynote on "A World of Resources".
