There are only 216 days until [RailsConf 2007](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails)! The 2nd annual International Rails Conference will be in Portland, Oregon on May 17-20, 2007. Don't worry, it's going to be a few months before tickets go on sale (and sell out instantly). But if you're thinking about submitting a proposal to speak at RailsConf, the time for that is fast approaching. Go to the conference website to answer the [call for proposals](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/create/e_sess) - the deadline for submissions is November 27, 2006.

If you're not planning a talk, you might want to go to the [conference wiki](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/wiki/railsconf2007) and leave [your ideas](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/wiki/railsconf2007/index.cgi?RailsConfIdeas) for what you'd like to see in the program.
