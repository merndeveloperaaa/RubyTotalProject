<p><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/">RailsConf</a> is going down next week in Vegas. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s going to be a great show and can&#8217;t wait to get out there. A few of the presenters have been blogging about the presentations that they&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>Alexander Dymo is doing a session on <a href="http://blog.pluron.com/2009/04/performance-freaks-live-at-railsconf-2009.html">Advanced Performance Optimization of Rails Applications</a>, Jason Rudolph has one on <a href="http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2009/03/24/railsconf-2009-javascript-testing-in-rails-projects-no-seriously/">testing JavaScript in Rails projects</a>, Pat Maddox is talking about <a href="http://www.patmaddox.com/blog/railsconf_2009_legacy_rails">dealing with legacy Rails projects</a>, and finally Sean Schofield just has <a href="http://railsdog.com/2009/04/five-reasons-to-go-to-railsconf/">five good reasons to attend the conference</a>.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/grid">the entire schedule for the conference</a> and signup if you haven&#8217;t already. See you in Vegas!</p>
