<p>The lighttpd team is well underway to remove the last major barrier for widespread adoption: File upload handling. Jan has written about <a href="http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2005/09/27/improved-upload-handling">the improved approach</a> to file uploads that&#8217;ll buffer to disk instead of keep it all in memory. We&#8217;re eagerly awaiting its arrival in 1.4.5.</p>
