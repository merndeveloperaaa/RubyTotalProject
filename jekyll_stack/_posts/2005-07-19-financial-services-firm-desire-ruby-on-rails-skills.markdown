<p>Cincom Smalltalk has long touted <a href="http://www.whysmalltalk.com/articles/JPMorgan.pdf">the Kapital system at JP Morgan</a> (<span class="caps">PDF</span>) as an example of what an edge in productivity can mean for profits in financial services. So, it&#8217;s not entirely surprising to see <a href="http://www.mscibarra.com/"><span class="caps">MSCI</span> Barra</a> from Berkley, California <a href="http://seeker.dice.com/jobsearch/servlet/JobSearch?op=101&amp;dockey=xml/0/0/009125d49dc8c61f3c28a1f6b6daf6ed@activejobs0&amp;c=1&amp;source=1">look for a senior software developer</a> and desire that the candidate has Ruby on Rails skills for use with their investment systems. I believe we may just have an E for Enterprise here.</p>
