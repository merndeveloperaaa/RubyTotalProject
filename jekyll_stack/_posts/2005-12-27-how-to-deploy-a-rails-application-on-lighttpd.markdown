<p>James Duncan Davidson has started a great series of recipes on deploying Rails applications. In <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/essay/2005/12/railsdeployment">Real Lessons for Rails Deployment</a>, he examined the different options you have and some of the pitfalls you should watch out for.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/essay/2005/12/railsonlighty">Deploying Rails with LightTPD</a>, James goes specific and tells you exactly how to get Rails going on lighttpd using SwitchTower for deployment.</p>
<p>This is great stuff and with more than a couple of deployed Rails applications under his belt, James is in a great position to share his knowledge. Can&#8217;t wait to read the further installments.</p>
