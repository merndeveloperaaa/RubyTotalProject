Hello there!

Yes, this is [Godfrey](https://twitter.com/chancancode) again. I am glad a lot of you found last week's [Cool Trick‚Ñ¢](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/2016/08/20/read-me-to-learn-a-cool-trick) useful. However, wouldn't life be pretty boring if you just keep getting useful information? So I figured I would change things up a bit by delivering you an issue full of bad puns, dad jokes and other useless information. Let's get to it!

### [This Week's Rails Contributors](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20160820-20160826)

This week, 11 new contributors along with 19 other returning contributors took some time to keep Rails chugging along.

### [Include The Content of "The Flash" In ETags](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/26250)

When confronted about [code bloat](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/22af62cf486721ee2e45bb720c42ac2f4121faf4#commitcomment-8110), DHH [does not take it lightly](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e50530ca3ab5db53ebc74314c54b62b91b932389). This week, he pulled another one of those moves by committing the content of [_The Flash_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439572) into the Rails codebase.

### [Redirect POST Requests With 307 Status Code](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/23941)

Chirag Singhal decided to stir up some drama here by sending browsers a **HTTP 307 "YOU JUST DON'T GET IT"** status code when upgrading POST/PUT/DELETE requests to HTTPS connections.

### [Remove over meta programming in AR::Relation](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/26182)

When Bogdan Gusiev dived into the AR::Relation code base, he was not pleased with what he saw. After making some tweaks in this PR, he seemed happy with the result. Why?

_Well._

( ‚Ä¢\_‚Ä¢)>‚åê‚ñ†-‚ñ†

(‚åê‚ñ†\_‚ñ†)

_It doesn't meta anymore._

[YEEEEAAAAAAAAHH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YMPAH67f4o)

### [Improve `tag_option` performance](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/26254)

Amadeus Folego identified&nbsp; **tag\_options** &nbsp;as a hotspot in his application and decided to help improve its performance by throwing in some frozen strings. Cool!

### [Update docs with Action Cable Redis dependency](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/26249)

Coming back from his vacation, Rafael Reggiani Manzo redis‚Ñ¢covered a new dependency for developing Rails. To ease the shock for the next person, he added the setup instructions to the guides.

### [Missing key should throw KeyError](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/1ec85cf9d8a6ad36c3c40cc08a0c7d8407e4b080)

Last but not least, Eileen M. Uchitelle committed a key error this week.
