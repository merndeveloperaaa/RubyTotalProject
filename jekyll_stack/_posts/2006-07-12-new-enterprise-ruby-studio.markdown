<p>Right on the heels of Martin Fowler writing up <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/EnterpriseRails.html">Enterprise Rails</a>, the Pragmatic Studio has announced the addition of their latest studio, <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby/">Enterprise Ruby</a>, the first of which will be taught by <a href="http://relevancellc.com/">Relevance LLC&#8217;s</a> Stu Halloway and Justin Gehtland in Boston, September 11-13.</p>
<p>Some of the material they&#8217;ll be covering includes metaprogramming, domain specific languages, <span class="caps">LDAP</span>, <span class="caps">XML</span>, and web services. These topics and more will help use learn how to <em>use the power and expressiveness of Ruby, and how to use it as your enterprise &#8220;glue.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Those who attended Stu Halloway and Justin Gehtland&#8217;s talk at RailsConf on Rails internals already know how engaging they are as speakers. They are also currently working on the upcoming Rails for Java Programmers book.</p>
<p>Though not Rails specific, they do incorporate Rails in parts of the course and learning such things as <span class="caps">LDAP</span> and web services in Ruby is directly applicable to your Rails work.</p>
