**While Supplies Last!** When the _Evented File-System Monitoring_ project landed on master, a contributor [pointed out a potential race condition](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/22254#issuecomment-156689313). After ( [a few](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/49a5b408c9e23b937e93f6355b7b0a49a4a23184) [attempts](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/4596c1a31902806a15c970a0e210942912b139b6), we have finally arrived at a solution to FREE us from the danger!

## Correction

### [ðŸ†“ `byebug` Upgrade Program](https://rubygems.org/gems/byebug/versions)

**Manufacturer Rebate!** In the [last issue](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/2015/11/21/railsconf-2016-frozen-hash-keys-faster-byebug-and-more), we recommended `byebug` 7.0. Turns out the latest version is actually 8.2.1 (as of this week), which addressed some issue with the 7.0 release.

To compansate you for the trouble, we decided to offer a FREE `byebug` upgrade program for our readers. Simply change your `Gemfile` entry accordingly and run `bundle install`, and our agents will make sure the library is upgraded.
