<p>Tim O&#8217;Reilly <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/2004/perl_0707.html">responds to a concerned programmer</a> that is pondering the relevance of Perl in the face of competition from <span class="caps">PHP</span>, Python, and the statics .<span class="caps">NET</span>/J2EE.</p>
<p>Tim concurs that other languages have been gaining rapidly while Perl hasn&#8217;t. And as the original question didn&#8217;t mention Ruby nor Rails, he takes the opportunity to present the O&#8217;Reilly perspective on the duo:</p>
<blockquote>The other scripting language (in addition to Perl, Python, and <span class="caps">PHP</span>) that we&#8217;re paying a lot more attention to these days is Ruby. The Ruby On Rails framework has taking the world by storm, and has gone one up on <span class="caps">PHP</span> in terms of making database backed application programming a piece of cake.</blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the era of quick&#8217;n&#8217;clean.</p>
