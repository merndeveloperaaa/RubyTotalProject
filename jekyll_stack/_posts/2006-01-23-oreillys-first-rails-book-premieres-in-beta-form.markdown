<p><img src="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/covers/rubyrails_rc.s.gif" border="0" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px" />O&#8217;Reilly has <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/01/the_long_snout.html">launched</a> their Rough Cuts series with <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rubyrails/">Ruby on Rails: Up and running</a> as one of the first titles leading the charge. Rough Cuts is O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s version of <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/faqs/beta_faq.html">Beta Books</a> or <a href="http://manning.com/about/meap">Early Access</a> and gives you access to the content while it&#8217;s still being written.</p>
<p>Ruby on Rails: Up and running is written by Bruce Tate and Curt Hibbs. The final book is expected in May. Also of note for Railers on Rough Cut is <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rubyckbk/">Ruby Cookbook</a> by Leonard Richardson and Lucas Carlson. That one is expected done in September. Not to be confused with the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/index.html">Rails Recipes</a> by Chad Fowler (featuring recipes and secrets from the 37signals dome) that&#8217;ll be out in February.</p>
<p>So that marks four books currently available in final or beta form that focuses exclusively or partly on Rails: <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> (the original bible), <a href="http://www.rapidwebdevelopment.de/">Rapid Web Development mit Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rubyrails/">Ruby on Rails: Up and running</a>, and <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rubyckbk/">Ruby Cookbook</a>. That&#8217;s quite an achievement already!</p>
<p>And coming soon will be Chad Fowler&#8217;s Rails Recipes and David A. Black&#8217;s Ruby for Rails, which will bring us to a total of six books. And I believe there&#8217;s at least a good handful of additional books in the works. Rails is certainly on track to be the best documented web framework for the dynamic languages. Rock on.</p>
