<p>The venerable Big Nerd Ranch have just announced that they&#8217;re offering an intensive <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/classes/ruby.shtml">5-day course in Ruby on Rails</a>. The man at the wheel is none other than Rails core member Marcel Molina. The Big Nerd Ranch package is definitely a treat that includes &quot;&#8230;a student guide, a luxury room, three delicious meals a day, a stylish &#8220;Big Nerd Ranch&#8221; t-shirt, and transportation to and from the airport&quot;. All for a clean $3,500.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been thinking about digging into Rails, but haven&#8217;t had the time to get dedicated yet, this is the retreat for you.</p>
