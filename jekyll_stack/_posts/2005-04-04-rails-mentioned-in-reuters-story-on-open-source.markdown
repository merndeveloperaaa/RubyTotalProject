<p>The rise of small outfits building big things on constrained budgets is the theme of a <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=581&amp;e=1&amp;u=/nm/20050402/tc_nm/column_pluggedin_dc">Reuters story carried by Yahoo! News</a>. It includes a quote by Tim O&#8217;Reilly and talks among others about Odeo. And of particular interest on these parts about their use of Ruby on Rails:</p>
<blockquote>Evan Williams, who helped create Blogger software and later sold it to Google, is working with a small group of developers in San Francisco, to build Odeo, a highly anticipated new application due out in the next few weeks. Odeo relies on a freely available set of simple yet powerful database programing tools known as Ruby on Rails.</blockquote>
