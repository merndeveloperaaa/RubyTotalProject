<p>Brian McCallister is <a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/src/ruby/rails-is-no-fun.html">frustrated</a> that Ruby on Rails is taking away his joyful life as a tool smith. Always creating new libraries and frameworks. Now with all that stuff taken care of, he&#8217;s left having to do <i>the actual work</i>:</p>
<blockquote>Along comes RoR, now I find myself having to bear down and implement the actually business functionality for the application. Now it is &#8220;implement a <span class="caps">SOAP</span>/<span class="caps">HTTP</span> service to allow the Swing client to post back its offline changes&#8221; and &#8220;build an arbitrarily queryable entity-change audit report.&#8221; This is no fun compared to writing a config file parser or persistence abstraction layer that can transparently swap out any number of relational databases, orm frameworks, ldap backends, or transaction log based in-memory systems!</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s bad news when you&#8217;re a self-professed &#8220;library and framework writing junky&#8221;. At least he gets to talk about it. Brian is doing a session at <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2005/EU/index.html/e=MjAwNS9FVQ">ApacheCon Europe</a> later this month entitled <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/html/session-popup.html?id=1299">Cheap, Fast, and Good: You can have it all with Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>
<p>Have a great conference, Brian!</p>
