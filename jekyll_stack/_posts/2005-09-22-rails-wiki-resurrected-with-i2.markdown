<p>The Rails <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails">wiki is back</a> running on a brand-new engine called <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/browser/tools/i2/">i2</a>. It&#8217;s a fresh rewrite of Instiki with all the cruft cut out, most of the features, and of course Madeleine. It&#8217;s not currently suitable as an alternative for the personal wiki sphere. The real Instiki still reigns supreme for ease-of-use. But it&#8217;s a way to get an Instiki-like wiki that&#8217;s prepared for a wiki the size of the Rails one.</p>
<p>The import from Instiki didn&#8217;t go entirely smooth, so we&#8217;ll need some help cleaning up any deficiencies. Please do give a hand.</p>
<p>Trivia: i2 was written from scratch in about 6 hours by yours truly and consists of 214 lines of code (and 120 lines of testing code).</p>
