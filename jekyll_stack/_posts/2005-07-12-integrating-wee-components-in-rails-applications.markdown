<p>Michael Neumann has released a new version of <a href="http://www.ntecs.de/viewcvs/viewcvs/*checkout*/Wee/trunk/doc/rdoc/index.html">Wee</a>, which allows for integration of its components with Rails applications. He wrote up <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/msg/4d939b8705c37390">a small tutorial</a> on how to do it with the release notes. Wee is a component-centrific framework inspired by Seaside from Smalltalk. Looks mighty interesting, thanks for integrating, Michael.</p>
