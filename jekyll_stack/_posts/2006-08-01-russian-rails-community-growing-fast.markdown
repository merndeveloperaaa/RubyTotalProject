<p>Yaroslav Markin wrote to inform me that the Russian Rails community is experiencing rapid growth and that they&#8217;ve now completed a translation of the entire site living at <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.ru/">www.rubyonrails.ru</a>. If you speak Russian and want to join the community, they already have hundreds of members in their <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ror2ru">Google Groups forum</a>.</p>
<p>Do you know of any other local Rails groups making headway? Please post in the comments.</p>
