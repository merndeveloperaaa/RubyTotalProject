The original Rails book, Agile Web Development with Rails, is getting a facelift and <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition">the 3rd edition is now available as a beta book</a>.</p>
<p>The book will be targeting Rails 2 and thus cover the many improvements in features and idioms that Rails have seen since the last edition of the book.</p>
<p>We also have a new author on board with the project: <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby</a>. Sam co-authored the wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/RESTful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1208984959&sr=8-1">RESTful Web Services</a> and have been involved with the Ruby and Rails communities for quite some time now. It&#8217;s fantastic to have him involved with the book.</p>
