<p>We&#8217;ve been taking our sweet time, but now it really is almost there. We&#8217;ve just pushed new beta gems to gems.rubyonrails.org and created <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/tags/rel_2-0-0_RC1/">the rel_2-0-0_RC1 tag</a>. So this is shaping up to be the last chance to raise concerns for Rails 2.0 before we go final in oh-so-shortly.</p>
<p>So please give it a spin. First, upgrade to 1.2.5 if you haven&#8217;t already. Fix all the deprecation warnings you see. Then try to jump on Rails 2.0 and see if it runs. If it doesn&#8217;t, and you think it&#8217;s not because of something you did wrong, please create a ticket.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to be running this release candidate phase over the next couple of weeks, give or take depending on how many issues are raised.</p>
<p>You can read all about why you should actually care about Rails 2.0 in <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2007/9/30/rails-2-0-0-preview-release">the original preview release announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The gem version for this release is 1.99.0.</p>
