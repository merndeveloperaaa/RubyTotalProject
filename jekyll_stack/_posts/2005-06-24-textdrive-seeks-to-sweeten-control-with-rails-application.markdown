<p>TextPanel is the name of <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a>&#8216;s effort to modernize Webmin and the whole of branch of control panel software. <a href="http://weblog.textdrive.com/article/115/a-funny-thing-happened">They&#8217;re hard at work on it</a>. And it&#8217;s going to be a Rails application, of course. Like all the other management software they&#8217;re building over there. The first we&#8217;ll see of TextPanel will be a reduced version, which will power the forthcoming <a href="http://www.strongspace.com/">Strongspace</a> offering.</p>
<p>Cheers to Justin, Marten, Jason, Dean, and all the others at TextDrive for pushing the hosting envelope on so many fronts. And what a steal in <a href="http://weblog.textdrive.com/article/116/welcoming-michael-koziarski">picking up a relationship with Michael Koziarski</a>. He has been the untiring force behind verifying, prioritizing, and managing <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/report/9">the ticket cue</a> on Rails for a good long while. Congratulations to both parties.</p>
