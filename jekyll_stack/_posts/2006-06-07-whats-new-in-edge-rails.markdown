[Ryan Daigle](http://www.ryandaigle.com) has recently started chronicling [new features in Edge Rails](http://www.ryandaigle.com/articles/category/whats-new-in-rails). He's doing a nice job of summarizing the new features, so if you don't feel like keeping an eye on the commit log yourself, cruise on over to Ryan's blog and read about the new goodies there.
