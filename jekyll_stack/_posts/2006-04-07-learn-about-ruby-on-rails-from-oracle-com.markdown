<p>Richard Monson-Haefel has a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/haefel-oracle-ruby.html">simple tutorial up on oracle.com</a> that describes how and why to use Ruby on Rails with an Oracle database. It&#8217;s great to see big organizations like Oracle take Rails serious enough to commission articles about it for their site.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also fitting since the Oracle database adapter in Rails now has a really strong team of contributors keeping it sharp. Michael Schoen in particular has done a fantastic job. He has set up an automated testing server for Oracle, so any new revision of the framework is automatically tested and run against Oracle. If any failure occurs, an email is sent out.</p>
<p>We invite guys working with DB2, MS <span class="caps">SQL</span>, Sybase, and the other commercial databases to do the same.</p>
