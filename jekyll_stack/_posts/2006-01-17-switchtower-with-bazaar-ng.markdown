<p>Damien Merenne has just announced a <a href="http://www.cosinux.org/blogs/dam/articles/2006/01/17/bazaar-ng-and-switchtower">Bazaar-NG <span class="caps">SCM</span> module for SwitchTower</a>. All you bzr users now have one less reason to <em>not</em> use SwitchTower.</p>
<p>Damien has given permission for this module to be included in the next SwitchTower release, too. If you&#8217;ve got a pet <span class="caps">SCM</span> that you&#8217;d like to see supported by SwitchTower, just take a look at Damien&#8217;s code to see how little it really takes to implement a new <span class="caps">SCM</span> module. Then, implement it and submit it as a patch to http://dev.rubyonrails.org/newticket.</p>
