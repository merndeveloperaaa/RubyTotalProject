Oh hi!  This is an announcement to let you all know that versions 5.0.3 and
5.1.1 of Ruby on Rails have been released!  These are just regular bugfix
releases, so no need to rush to upgrade.  I mean, please do upgrade since
upgrading is good and you don't want to get behind, but I mean no need to spend
your weekend on these.

I've put the gem checksums below and links to the changelogs (check the P.S. at
the end of this post if you are going to read the changelog) in each gem.

Have a happy Friday, and a good weekend!

Sincerely,

Tenderlove

### P.S.

This is really embarassing, and I'm really sorry, but I forgot to update the
version numbers in the changelogs before doing the release.  So if you click
a link to a changelog, and the top of it says the previous version (5.0.2 or
5.1.0) it means there are no changes to that gem, and that I am not so good at
my job of releasing gems.  Again, I'm really sorry about this!
