<p>Since Rails is supposedly this &uuml;ber-productive bag of lightning bolts, you should be able to accomplish great things within a single clip of 24 hours, right? That&#8217;s the assumption Rails Day is setting out to prove. A competition to build something meaningful, cool, neat, and/or beautiful that&#8217;ll be judged by a panel of experts including yours truly and Dave Thomas.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even a great give-away happening. The best applications can win an Apple Mac Mini (courtesy of the ever-fantastic <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a>&mdash; are you signed up yet?), an iPod Mini from the crew at <a href="http://www.odeo.com">Odeo</a>, 6 books from the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/bookshelf/index.html">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a>, lifetime <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> basic subscription, and more. It&#8217;s a true shower of gifts.</p>
<p>The whole shebang is going down on June 4th. Read more at <a href="http://railsday.com/">Railsday.com</a>.</p>
