<p>Rick Olson is getting jiggy with Active Resource these days and decided to spread the love with a <a href="http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/2006/12/13/taking-ares-out-for-a-test-drive">brief introduction</a> to the newest member of the Rails framework family. He takes you through how to use ARes as a client for the Beast forum in a few simple steps. Get your <span class="caps">REST</span> face on and enjoy.</p>
