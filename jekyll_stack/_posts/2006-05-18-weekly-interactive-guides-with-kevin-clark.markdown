<p><a href="http://glu.ttono.us/">Kevin Clark</a>, the guy whose recently  taken on the documentation cleanup project, is diversifying his documentation work. His latest idea: <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/05/17/a-guide-a-week-lets-go-interactive">weekly interactive guides</a>.</p>
<p>Write into Kevin with requests on a specific Rails related topic that you&#8217;d like to understand better. He chooses a topic from your requests each week and builds a guide around that topic.</p>
<p>Get your submissions in by Monday to kevin dot clark at gmail dot com. Include <strong>[idea]</strong> at the start of the Subject. He&#8217;ll have the guide ready by the following Monday.</p>
