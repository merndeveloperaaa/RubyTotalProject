<p>Sacha Ebach shows you how to deal with multi-lingual applications in <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/82">Using Gettext to translate your Rails application</a>. It&#8217;s a complete guide talking about what tools you need, the structure you should impose, and what Rails need to instructed to do in order to make your application speak more than just English. Great stuff.</p>
