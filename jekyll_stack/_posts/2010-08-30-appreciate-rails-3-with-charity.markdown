<p>Rails 3.0 is a gift from all of us who&#8217;ve worked on it to anyone who wants to build something. If you like our gift, please show it by donating to the Rails 3.0 release charity: Charity:Water. We&#8217;ve started a campaign to raise $100,000 in the name of Rails 3.0, which will give 5,000 people access to clean water if we make it.</p>
<p>Charity:Water is a fantastic charity (and not just because they run on Rails!). You&#8217;d make everyone working on Rails proud by helping us reach our lofty goal.</p>
<p>Donations can be made at <a href="http://mycharitywater.org/rails3">http://mycharitywater.org/rails3</a>.</p>
