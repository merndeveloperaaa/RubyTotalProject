<p>Two more Rails jobs ticked into my mailbox today. <a href="http://jobs.rubynow.com/jobs/show/23">One with Bluebin Industries in Los Angeles</a>, <a href="http://whurleyvision.blogspot.com/2005/10/new-austin-based-start-up-seeks.html">another with a new  Austin-based Start-up</a>. If you got the Rails chops and is not paying the bills with &#8217;em, you should be ashamed of yourself.</p>
