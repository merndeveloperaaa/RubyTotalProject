<p>Joe O&#8217;Brien is teaching Ruby on Rails to the consultants at <a href="http://www.sarkcolumbus.com/">his company</a> and is <a href="http://blog.objo.com/archives/13-In-awe-a-week-with-Rails.html">especially enjoying</a> how the language and framework two-pack makes agile development so natural:</p>
<blockquote>Ruby and Rails have captured my heart and mind, not only because of the simplicity of the language itself, but also because of how much easier I can use agile development techniques without feeling as if I&rsquo;m doing something outside the norm. No, I&rsquo;m not saying agile development with Java is impossible, but I&rsquo;m saying with Ruby and Rails, agile development seems natural, and almost a part of the language.</blockquote>
<p>We call that &#8220;best practices by invitation&#8221;. By generating test stubs, having wiring for mocks ready to be dumped in, following a consistent directory structure all makes it easier to do the right thing. Less chores, more benefits.</p>
