<p>Craig Walls is the coauthor of both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932394354/habumacom-20/002-6150913-2503248">Spring in Action</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932394052/habumacom-20/002-6150913-2503248">XDoclet in Action</a>. Recently, he had &#8220;&#8230;come to the conclusion that I could not ignore Rails any longer&#8221;. This is <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/habuma/20050324">what he found</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Honestly, I&#8217;m quite impressed. <b>I found that the productivity claims surrounding Rails to be quite accurate</b>. After writing only a single line of code, I had a reasonably functional application. Adding a couple of more lines, I had a one-to-many relationship between two model objects. The biggest chunk of work comes in customizing the view, but that&#8217;s to be expected because there&#8217;s no way that Rails can anticipate your desired look-and-feel. All in all, I spent 15 minutes putting together a simple application that might have taken me several hours with any of the other frameworks that I&#8217;m familiar with.</blockquote>
<p>My emphasis. This is the same conclusion that Bruce Tate has been talking about. It actually <i>does</i> rapidly improve your ability to deliver working software. Is the factor 2, 5, or 10 times? Who knows (and cares?). How about we just settle it at it&#8217;s enough of an improvement that you ought to try it out for size.</p>
