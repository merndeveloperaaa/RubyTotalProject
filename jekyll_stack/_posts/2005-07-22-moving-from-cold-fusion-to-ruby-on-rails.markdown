<p>Greg from Social Twister <a href="http://socialtwister.com/archives/000548.html">wants to hire Ruby on Rails developers</a> to help the company move various Cold Fusion applications to their new platform. Greg writes about CF vs RoR:</p>
<blockquote>For my fellow CFers out there, I&#8217;ll simply say that I still love CF, but Rails Rocks. My CF code was written very similar to the way Rails works now so it made a lot of sense. We&#8217;re planning to open source at least one major part of our system and that&#8217;s going to require something that&#8217;s freely available unfortunately.</blockquote>
