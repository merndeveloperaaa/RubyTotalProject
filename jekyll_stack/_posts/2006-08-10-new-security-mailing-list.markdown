<p>In light of the past days of fun and games, we&#8217;ve started a new mailing list focused entirely around security. This list will be much lower volume than the main list and be exclusively about security concerns. You can signup at the <a href="http://lists.rubyonrails.org/mailman/listinfo/rails-security">rails-security mailing list</a> page.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: This an announce only list. So you won&#8217;t get spammed unless it matters.</p>
