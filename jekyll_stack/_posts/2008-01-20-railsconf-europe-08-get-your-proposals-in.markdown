<p>The call for participation for <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com">RailsConf Europe &#8216;08</a> has opened up and we&#8217;re now accepting proposals. The conference is returning to Berlin and the conference will happen between the 2nd and 4th of September.</p>
<p>Last year was an absolute blast. There&#8217;s such a great diversity of people from all over Europe and beyond. It&#8217;s a great addition to the much more US-focused bang of RailsConf in the US.</p>
<p>Also, have in mind that the program for RailsConf Europe is usually pretty much completely different from the US fanfare. So it&#8217;s okay to submit your proposal here as well. What might be accepted at RailsConf in the US might not go for RailsConf Europe and vice versa.</p>
<p>Anyway, looking forward to reading about those proposals!</p>
