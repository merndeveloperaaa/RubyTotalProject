<p>Curt Hibbs just have keeps delivering the good stuff and O&#8217;Reilly wisely keeps serving it up. The new article is called <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/06/09/rails_ajax.html">Ajax on Rails</a>. It builds upon his two earlier articles about getting rolling and puts the focus on introducing the sugar-coated sweetness that is the Ajax support of Rails. There&#8217;s even a good rundown of what Ajax is and where it came from.</p>
<p>As has become the norm, Hibbs also secured Rails its <i>fifth</i> <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/11/1317218">Slashdotting</a>. Keep &#8216;em coming, Curt (and O&#8217;Reilly editors!).</p>
