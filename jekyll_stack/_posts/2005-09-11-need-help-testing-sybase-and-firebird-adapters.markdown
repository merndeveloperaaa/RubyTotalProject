<p>We have two new pending database adapters that could use some solid testing by people who have access to those engines. The first is a <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/ticket/2030">Sybase adapter by Will Sobel</a> and the second is a <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/ticket/1874">Firebird adapter by Ken Kunz</a>.</p>
<p>Please give both of them a spin and add any comments on their tickets. Also, be sure to note if either of the adapters should do something that doesn&#8217;t match the idiosyncratic approach in either of those engines.</p>
