<p>Lars Hoss wanted an <span class="caps">XML</span>-<span class="caps">RPC</span> interface to his Rails-based weblog, so he <a href="http://woeye.highteq.net/blog/details/77">hacked up</a> a quick prototype:</p>
<p><img src="http://web.rubyonrails.com/pictures/xmlrpcprototype.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Pretty neat! We&#8217;re currently investigating a number of different schemes for how to officially support Web Services (<span class="caps">SOAP</span>/<span class="caps">XML</span>-<span class="caps">RPC</span>) &#8220;The Rails Way&#8221;. Where getting good support from two of the commercial entities using Rails for their work. Announcements will follow.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and Lars is a Tapestry convert, by the way. On the experience with switching from Java/Tapestry to Ruby on Rails, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>Though I still like Tapestry very much, I prefer Rails for my private projects. Private free time is spare and Rails helps me to use it more efficient.</blockquote>
