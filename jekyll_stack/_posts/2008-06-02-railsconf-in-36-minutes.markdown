<p>Gregg Pollack has made <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/6/2/Railsconf-videos">a great video with interviews of speakers and attendants at RailsConf</a> as a way of giving people who weren&#8217;t there a taste of what it was like. The result is 36 minutes of video and really worth watching. Check it out.</p>
