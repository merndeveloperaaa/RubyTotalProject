<p>The Berlin Ruby User Group is throwing a pre-RailsConf party under the banner of <a href="http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com/">Bratwurst on Rails</a>.</p>
<p>The Ruby User Group Berlin is one of the biggest in Germany and therefore we&#8217;re pleased to organize an event on the night before the RailsConf Europe. In the tradition of last year&#8217;s &#8220;Pizza on Rails&#8221; the event is called &#8220;Bratwurst On Rails.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event is an opportunity to socialize and meet the conference participants in a relaxed atmosphere, and to make your name or brand known amongst them. Tighten your knots with the community by becoming a sponsor.</p>
<p>The venue will be in the heart of Berlin, close to the conference venue. Entry will be free, as will the food. (If you&#8217;re interested in sponsoring, have a look at our sponsoring packages and feel free to contact the organisation board via sponsoring@bratwurst-on-rails.com).</p>
