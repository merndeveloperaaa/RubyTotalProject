<p>After months and months of deliciously teasing screenshots, the real deal is now out for the world to see. The <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">official Ruby language website</a> has been redesigned. And what a wonderful design it is. Congratulations to the visual identity team and the contributors. It&#8217;s truly a work to be proud of.</p>
