<p><a href="http://amrita2.rubyforge.org/">Amrita2</a> is a template engine that separates template logic and content. It&#8217;s a very  different style than the standard ERb approach of Rails, but if squeaky clean <span class="caps">HTML</span> templates tickle your fancy, this is the place to go. The latest version is <a href="http://amrita2.rubyforge.org/Rails.html">all wrapped up as a Rails</a> plugin, which makes it silly easy to install and play with.</p>
