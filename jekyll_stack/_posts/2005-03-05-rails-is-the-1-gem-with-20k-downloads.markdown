<p>Rails has now assumed the #1 gem spot with 20,801 downloads at the time of writing. Just in front of Rake, which have long had a solid lead as a required dependency to Rails. Out of the 11 gems listed on the top downloads table on the cover of RubyForge, Rails is now responsible for the six of them.</p>
<p><i>Funny side note: The two programmers at 37signals (yours truly and Jamis Buck) stewards 8 out of 11 gems listed on the hit list.</i></p>
