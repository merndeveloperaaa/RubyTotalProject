<p>Ryan Davis has cooked up a <a href="http://blog.zenspider.com/archives/2005/09/zero_to_rails_i.html">really cool video of Rails done quick</a>. He uses OmniGraffle to design his schema, converts this to <span class="caps">SQL</span>, triggers a few home-grown scripts, and whammo! A complete Rails scaffolded application with people and phones in less than two minutes. Hot diggity!</p>
