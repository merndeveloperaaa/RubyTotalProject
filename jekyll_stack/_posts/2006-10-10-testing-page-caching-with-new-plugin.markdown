<p>Damien Merenne has created a <a href="http://blog.cosinux.org/pages/page-cache-test">swank plugin for page cache testing</a>. Whether caching has happened or they&#8217;ve been expired. Quite useful for testing sweeper logic, which, like any caching techniques, are often susceptible to subtle invalidation bugs. Hopefully Merenne will continue work on his plugin and extend it to deal with action and fragment caching too. That&#8217;d put it on the fast track for core inclusion.</p>
