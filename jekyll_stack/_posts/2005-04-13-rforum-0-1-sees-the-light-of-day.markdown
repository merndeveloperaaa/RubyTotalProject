<p><a href="http://rforum.andreas-s.net/trac/">RForum</a> is one of the earliest open source applications based on Rails, but it has only just reached a state where the authors Andreas Schwarz and Alexey Verkhovsky were willing to share with the world. Hence, the release of RForum 0.1.</p>
<p>Congratulations on the release. With the project out in the open, we&#8217;ll hopefully more rapid improvement towards a 1.0 release.</p>
