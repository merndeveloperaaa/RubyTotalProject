<p>There was a time where I would have jumped in and attempted to educate <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0135826/2005/09/08.html#a167">a guy like Debu Panda</a>. Now it&#8217;s more of a comical relief. Like when old people talk about how they&#8217;re never going to get a cell phone with an off sense of smug:</p>
<blockquote>If you are looking to build a web application with <span class="caps">LAMP</span> then it may be simple to develop but it may have scalability issues and maintainability issues due to it&#8217;s inherent architecture.</blockquote>
<p>Like, whatever, dude.</p>
