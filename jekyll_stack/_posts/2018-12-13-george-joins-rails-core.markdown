We couldn't be happier to welcome [George Claghorn](https://github.com/georgeclaghorn) to [Rails core](https://rubyonrails.org/community/#core). George has been the co-creator of both [Active Storage](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) and [Action Mailbox](https://rubyonrails.org/2018/12/13/introducing-action-mailbox-for-rails-6).

His [work on Rails](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/george-claghorn/commits) has not just included bringing these exciting new frameworks into the Rails work, but also continuing to lead maintenance and process community feedback and improvements.

George is our first deaf person on the team ❤️🎉👏
