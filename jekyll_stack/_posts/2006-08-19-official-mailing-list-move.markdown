<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you see some mailing list subscriptions in your inbox, we&#8217;re simply transferring everything to Google Groups.  This takes the incredible load off the Ruby on Rails server so it can focus on Trac, and gives everyone a Google-powered search engine for the archives.  Atom feeds are also available if that&#8217;s your preference.  Here are the new Google Groups:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk">rubyonrails-talk</a> &#8211; Discuss general Ruby on Rails topics.</li>
	<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-spinoffs">rubyonrails-spinoffs</a> &#8211; Talk about script.aculo.us and Prototype as they fit inside of Rails and outside.</li>
	<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security">rubyonrails-security</a> &#8211; Security annoucements for Ruby on Rails.</li>
	<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core">rubyonrails-core</a> &#8211; Discussion list for Ruby on Rails core development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey everyone, lets give the new rubyonrails-security list a warm welcome.  It is an announcement-only list spawned from the lessons learned during the recent security incident.</p>
<p>By the way, it&#8217;s possible to <a href="http://groups.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=12346&amp;topic=251">subscribe to a Google Group without a Google account</a>.</p>
