<p>Curt Hibbs has released <a href="http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/">Instant Rails</a> for Windows. It&#8217;s a package of everything needed to get Ruby on Rails running on Apache and MySQL. It&#8217;s nicely done as just a single directory, so it doesn&#8217;t spread itself all over the system. It&#8217;s perfect for trying out Rails in no time at all.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on OS X, you should look into <a href="http://locomotive.sourceforge.net/">Locomotive</a>. It&#8217;s a similar system for macheads.</p>
