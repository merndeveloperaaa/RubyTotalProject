<p>Our current web and mail server has been buckling under the load of the recent frenzy. Especially Trac and mailman is taking it to its knees. So we&#8217;re going to add another server. Hopefully this can be completed within the next few days. It&#8217;s going to be dedicated to just running the repository and Trac. Thanks to TextDrive for their continued support of Ruby on Rails.</p>
