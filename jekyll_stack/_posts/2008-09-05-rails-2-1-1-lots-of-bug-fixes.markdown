<p>Rails 2.1.1 is another maintenance release that includes a bunch of bug fixes and a fix for <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2008/8/23/dos-vulnerabilities-in-rexml">the <span class="caps">REXML</span> vulnerability</a>. I&#8217;ve extracted all the <a href="http://gist.github.com/8946">changes from the CHANGELOGs into a single Gist</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<p>To install, just do: <code>gem install rails --version 2.1.1</code>.</p>
<p>Next upcoming release will be Rails 2.2 beta which is quite close.</p>
