<p>Josh C from the <a href="http://www.eggplant.coop/">Eggplant Coop</a> sent me the funniest switcher quote I&#8217;ve seen in a while:</p>
<blockquote>We compare moving to rails from our in-house perl web framework to the scene in &#8220;Clerks&#8221; where Randall goes to the good video store ;)</blockquote>
