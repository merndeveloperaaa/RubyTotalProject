<p>As the art of Rails development matures,  so do the ways we teach and learn about it.  Following the release of Rails 1.1, the state of Rails training just took a small step forward along with it.</p>
<p>Mike Clark <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2006/04/02#AnnouncingProductionRails">just announced</a> a new course from the perpetually-sold-out <a href="http://www.pragmaticstudio.com">Pragmatic Studio</a> on <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/deploy/index.html">Production Rails</a> deployment.</p>
<p>Since the release of Rails, teams have been steadily forming around new products and projects in Rails.  While there have been a lot of great resources for learning how to do Rails <em>development_, this is the first in a sure-to-be-expanding market for training and documentation on how best to deploy and manage a production Rails application.  The course is being taught by <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails/index.html">Rails Studio</a> veteran and <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter">Pragmatic Project Automation</a></em>kit/au/index.html author <a href="http://clarkware.com">Mike Clark</a> and Rails deployment expert (not to mention creator of Tomcat and Ant) <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/about">James Duncan Davidson</a>.</p>
<p>The location and exact time haven&#8217;t yet been decided, so <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/deploy/register.html">signing up to be notified</a> just <em>may</em> have an impact.</p>
<p>How do you think the training and documentation market for Rails will continue to evolve? What would <em>you</em> like to see next?</p>
