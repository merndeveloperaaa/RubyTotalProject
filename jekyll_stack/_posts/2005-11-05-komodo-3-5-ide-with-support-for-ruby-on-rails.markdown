<p><a href="http://www.radrails.org/">RadRails</a> is getting company from commercial player ActiveState that has recently shipped <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/">Komodo 3.5</a>, their <span class="caps">IDE</span> for dynamic languages. Komodo features support for Ruby and Rails and is available on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Komodo Professional is a $295 buy, Komodo personal is $29.95, and there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.activestate.com/store/trial/register.plex?id=Komodo">21-day trial</a> available.</p>
<p>The release got a bit of play in the press with an InfoWorld article called <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/11/02/HNruby_1.html">Ruby <span class="caps">IDE</span> is set to shine</a>.</p>
<p>Being a OS X/<a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a> user myself, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to checkout Komodo. Please do add your experiences in the comments for others to share.</p>
