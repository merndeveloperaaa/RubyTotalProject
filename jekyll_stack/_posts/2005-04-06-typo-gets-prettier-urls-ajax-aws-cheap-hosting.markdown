<p>Tobias L&uuml;tke&#8217;s <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">blogging engine Typo</a> is storming ahead with good stuff lately. He recently <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/articles/2005/04/02/say-bye-to-articles-read-5">implemented even-prettier URLs</a> and <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/articles/2005/04/02/ajax-rocks">Ajaxed the comments section</a>. Now Patrick Lenz has brought the web service integration into the world of Action Web Service.</p>
<p>The metaWeblog, MT, and the Blogger APIs have all been implemented. And Patrick has been so nice as to <a href="http://poocs.com/articles/2005/04/05/lifting-typo-onto-actionwebservice">walk us through the entire procedure</a>.</p>
<p>If any of this has made you hot for Typo, Planet Argon is <a href="http://www.planetargon.com/blog_hosting/">offering Typo hosting</a> for as low as $3/month. And  Patrick also did a <a href="http://poocs.net/files/mt3.rb">migration script</a> for moving from MT 3.x to Typo.</p>
<p>It appears that my excuses for still running Loud Thinking on Movable Type and this blog on WordPress are growing even thinner. Expect a transition in the not-too-distant future.</p>
