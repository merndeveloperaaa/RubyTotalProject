<p>I&#8217;ve introduced the new [<span class="caps">RESEARCH</span>] prefix to ticket summaries in addition to the existing [<span class="caps">PATCH</span>]. By applying the [<span class="caps">RESEARCH</span>] prefix, you&#8217;re sharing a patch with the world that either needs additional testing, suggestions, or development before being ready for trunk inclusion. We have a new report as well to show the <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/report/4">research patches</a> of which there are currently five.</p>
