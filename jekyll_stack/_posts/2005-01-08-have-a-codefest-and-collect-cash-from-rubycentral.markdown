<p>Chad Fowler just <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Ruby/FreeMoney.rdoc,v">reminded</a> the Ruby community that free money is up for grabs if you have a cool idea for a codefest. There&#8217;s a total of $1,500 in the pot and $500 max on a per-project basis. Chad suggests a couple of ideas that could get a grant:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ruby Subversion bindings</li>
	<li><strong>A nice bug tracker in Rails</strong></li>
	<li>Something that simplifies the open source ruby library release process, integrating <span class="caps">RAA</span>, RubyForge, ruby-talk, Freshmeat, and RubyGems</li>
</ul>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Get the band together and <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org/grant/application.html">apply</a> for the <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org/grant/announce.html">Ruby Codefest Grant Program</a>.</p>
