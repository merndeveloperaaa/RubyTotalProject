<p>While videos and talk are all nice and good, it&#8217;s the applications built that has the power to propel frameworks into stardom. <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> has served as a flag bearer for a long time, but with the launch of <a href="http://43things.com">43 Things</a>, it&#8217;s finally getting some assistance from another high profile public site. Alexander Payne takes note:</p>
<blockquote>43 Things was built on Rails. Rails delights me in portions of my being that I never knew existed, much less were capable of being delighted by a web application framework. My infatuation with Ruby, dormant two long years, has been mightily rekindled by Rails. I really quite genuinely want to <a href="http://43things.com/things/view/7920">drink a beer or 12</a> with David Heinemeier Hansson.</blockquote>
<p>Sure thing, Alexander. I&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.37signals.com/workshop-basecamp.php">be in Seattle</a> from the 26th until the 30th. Maybe we can figure out a night out for Rails developers and interested.</p>
