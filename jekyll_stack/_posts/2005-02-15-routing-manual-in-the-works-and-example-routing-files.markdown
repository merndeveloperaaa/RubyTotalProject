<p>Nicholas has started a <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/65">manual</a> to explain what Routing in Rails is all about and how you use it. It&#8217;s still very much a work in progress, but its an excellent start to learn more about Routing.</p>
<p>In addition, you can see the routes.rb definition <a href="http://rafb.net/paste/results/hN9i7t64.html">for Basecamp</a> and <a href="http://rafb.net/paste/results/a5W5eR95.html">for a commerce application</a> Mindel is working on.</p>
