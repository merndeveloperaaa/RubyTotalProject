<p>Word on the street is that popular webhost <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> now supports Ruby on Rails. That&#8217;s great news, especially if you&#8217;re already married to DH and wants to do Ruby on Rails development. For everyone else starting out or looking for a new host, the premier choice for Rails hosting is naturally still <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a>. They have multiple Railers on staff, support the Rails project, and rock (this site is running on TextDrive).</p>
