<p>After another batch of fixes, tweaks, and buckets of polish, we&#8217;ve prepared the hopefully last step before 2.0 can go final: Release Candidate 2. If nothing major pops up, expect the final version to land within the next week or two at the most.</p>
<p>As usual, we got the latest gems on the gems.rubyonrails.org server and there&#8217;s <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/tags/rel_2-0-0_RC2/">a RC2 tag</a> as well. Please put this final test through the ringer so we can get a clean 2.0.0 final release.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t kept up to date on what&#8217;s new in 2.0, have a look at <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2007/9/30/rails-2-0-0-preview-release">the original preview release announcement</a>. The gem version for this release is 1.99.1. Enjoy!</p>
