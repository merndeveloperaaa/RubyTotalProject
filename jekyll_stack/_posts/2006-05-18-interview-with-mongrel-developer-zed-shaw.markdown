<p><a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/">Zed Shaw&#8217;s</a> new (mostly) Ruby webserver <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">Mongrel</a> has been getting people&#8217;s attention lately. What started out as perhaps just an itch has turned into a full time project for Zed, backed by corporate funding.</p>
<p><a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/">Pat Eyler</a> caught up with Zed over at <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/">O&#8217;Reillynet</a> for an <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2006/05/post.html">interview</a> where Zed gives some details about the Mongrel project.</p>
<p>Many have already switched their apps over to use Mongrel. Keep an eye on it as an increasingly viable option for serving up your Rails applications.</p>
