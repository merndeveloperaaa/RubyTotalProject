<p>Rails is released under <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/trunk/railties/MIT-LICENSE"><span class="caps">MIT</span></a> and only includes packages that are either directly under <span class="caps">MIT</span> or were re-licensed specifically for Rails under <span class="caps">MIT</span>. But not all plugins, generators, engines, or other types of additions are as explicitly clear as to what license they&#8217;re released under. It would be great if they were.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re the creator of a Rails addition of any kind, please do pick a license and include it with your software. I recommend <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/trunk/railties/MIT-LICENSE"><span class="caps">MIT</span></a>.</p>
