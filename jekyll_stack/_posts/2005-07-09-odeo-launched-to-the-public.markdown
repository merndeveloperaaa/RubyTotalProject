<p><a href="http://www.odeo.com/">Odeo</a> is a portal for finding, syncing, and creating podcasts. It&#8217;s might neat and of course it&#8217;s mighty Rails. Congratulations to the team for finally making the jump into the public limelight.</p>
<p>Having a portal like this is exactly the final nudge that we needed to get Scott Barron to kick off his forth coming podcasting show about Rails.</p>
