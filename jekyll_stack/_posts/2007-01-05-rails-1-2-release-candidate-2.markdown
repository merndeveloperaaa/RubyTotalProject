<p>This is it. We&#8217;re a mere two shakes of a lamb&#8217;s tail from releasing the final version of Rails 1.2. But before we light the fireworks and pop the champagne, we&#8217;ll just do one itsy, bitsy, tiny test run. Like wearing protection glasses in downtown Copenhagen on New Year&#8217;s. You know, just for precautions.</p>
<p>So please do give it a good run. We&#8217;re looking for <span class="caps">STOP</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BOAT</span> and <span class="caps">HOLD</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PRESSES</span> kind of issues for this one. Nothing else will stop it (but please do report every thing you find any way).</p>
<p>For a reminder on how to install and what&#8217;s new, see the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2006/11/23/rails-1-2-release-candidate-1">release notes for Release Candidate 1</a>. We also did a series of highlights for <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2006/11/26/1-2-new-in-activerecord">Active Record</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2006/11/26/1-2-new-in-actionpack">Action Pack</a>, and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2006/11/26/1-2-new-in-activesupport">Active Support</a>. Read those and hold your breath in anticipation. Unless a surge of heinous issues appear, we&#8217;re expecting the final version to land some times next week.</p>
<p>Yay, hurray!</p>
