<p>Duane Johnson has a great <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.rails/14513">how-to on productizing your application</a>. Which basically means that you have a core application that you need to tailor ever so slightly for each customer. How do you do that and still ensure high reuse? Well, that&#8217;s just what Duane&#8217;s approach explains.</p>
