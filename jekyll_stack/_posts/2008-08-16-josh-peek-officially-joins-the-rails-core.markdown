<p>Josh Peek has been a defacto Rails core committer for a while, but for some reason we&#8217;ve never actually made the appointment official. So here it goes: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/core">Josh Peek is the latest Rails core team member</a>. Three cheers hurray!</p>
<p>Josh has been working on a Google Summer of Code project to bring thread safety to Rails and is just about ready to wrap it up. Rails 2.2 will be thread safe thanks to the work that Josh has put into it.</p>
<p>Of more importance, though, is the significant effort put into making things faster and cleaner as part of that push. The actual thread safety won&#8217;t really matter much to most people, but it&#8217;ll surely look nice on your enterprisey check list of Features Your Framework Must Have To Get Play Around Here.</p>
<p>In any case, please welcome Josh!</p>
