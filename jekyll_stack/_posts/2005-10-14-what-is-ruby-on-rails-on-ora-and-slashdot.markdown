<p>Curt Hibbs is continuing his long-running series of articles for O&#8217;Reilly with <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/10/13/what_is_rails.html?page=1">What is Ruby on Rails?</a> It&#8217;s a great overview of all the frameworks in Rails and what it all means. And as typical for Hibbs&#8217; articles, the article got us <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/05/10/14/1219237.shtml?tid=156">Slashdotted for the 10th time</a>. Four of those times being of Hibbs&#8217; credit. Congratulations!</p>
