<p>_why has posted the mind bender of the week: <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/railsfsAfterACoupleMinutesOfToolingWithFuseWhoa.html">RailsFS</a>. With this nifty layer on top of FuseFS, you get to interact with your Active Record-driven domain model through the file system. The individual records open up as <span class="caps">YAML</span>-documents that you can interact with and the changes are persisted. Crazy, sexy, cool!</p>
