<p>Jim Weirich has just released <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a> 0.4.14 that includes the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2004/12/30/running-rake-tests-with-ruby-182/">fix by Dave Halliday</a> to cure test suite runnings with Ruby 1.8.2. You&#8217;ll want to grab this right away in preparation for your forthcoming upgrade to the latest Ruby release. And what better way to do that than with <code>gem install rake</code>. Thanks to Dave for the fix and Jim for the expedient release!</p>
