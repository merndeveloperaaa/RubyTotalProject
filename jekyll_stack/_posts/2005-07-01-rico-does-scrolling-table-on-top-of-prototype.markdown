<p>Sam Stephenson and I met the Sabre team at the O&#8217;Reilly/Adaptive Path Ajax Summit a few months back. Their presentation of a scrolling table was part of their very nice line-up of widgets build on Ajax. Talking with Bill and Darren, we got speaking about cooperation, which has now lead to their framework called <a href="http://openrico.org/home.page">Rico</a> being build on top of Prototype.</p>
<p>And now they have their LiveGrid widget ported to this framework that let&#8217;s you build long lists of endless scrolling (thousands of results without paging). They got an example with <a href="http://openrico.org/yahooSearch.page">Yahoo Search</a> and one with a <a href="http://openrico.org/livegrid.page">plain data table</a>. They currently only work in Firefox and IE, so no Safari (but that&#8217;s gotta be coming as Bill switched to the Mac at home).</p>
<p>Bill has a long post entilted <a href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/2005/06/death-to-paging-rico-livegrid-released.html">Death to Paging! &#8211; Rico LiveGrid Released</a> that further explains the workings of the widget. Good stuff, guys. Keep it coming.</p>
