<p>I&#8217;ve been receiving some very moving stories about how people came to be Rails programmers from incredibly diverse backgrounds over the years. I even talked to a taxi driver once who was taking me to the airport that was doing Rails. Or the guys who were looking to quit programming who started enjoying it again with Rails.</p>
<p>All these are powerful stories that I&#8217;d love if we could share with the world. So let&#8217;s try to do that! If you have a great story about how you came to Rails, then please send it to david at loudthinking dot com with the subject &#8220;My Rails story&#8221;. I&#8217;ll filter all those into a folder and we&#8217;ll find a way to publish them.</p>
