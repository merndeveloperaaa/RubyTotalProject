<p>Aptana has released <a href="http://www.aptana.com/radrails">RadRails 1.0</a> with a bunch of cool new features. I really like their debugging and profiling tools that allow you to inspect the call graph and see where the hot spots in your code are. The fact that RadRails is free and open source as well certainly doesn&#8217;t hurt.</p>
