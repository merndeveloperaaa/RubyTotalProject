<p>The fantastic team at Rails Envy is back with their Apple-style commercials comparing Ruby on Rails to a variety of competing environments. This time they have a one-two punch first <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/8/23/Rails-vs-NET">striking .<span class="caps">NET</span></a> and then <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/8/24/rails-vs-php">doing <span class="caps">PHP</span>/CakePHP</a>. As always, it&#8217;s funny stuff and really nicely done. Keep it up, boys!</p>
