<p><a href="http://paris.onrails.info/">Paris on Rails</a> is a French-speaking Rails conference that&#8217;s taking place in Paris on December 10th. They have <a href="http://paris.onrails.info/planning">a great program for the day with 10 speakers</a> (yours truly included via a video chat). If you speak French, check it out. The one-day event is 100 euro (or 70 euros before November 15th).</p>
