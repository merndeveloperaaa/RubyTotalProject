<p>Welcome to the fifth edition of This Week in Rails, a weekly report with highlights from the Rails community.  Antonio Cangiano (the original author) has been <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/09/09/a-status-update/">pretty busy</a>, so I figured I&#8217;d step in this week.</p>
<p>As you probably already know, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2008/9/3/rails-2-0-4-maintenance-release">Rails 2.0.4</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2008/9/5/rails-2-1-1-lots-of-bug-fixes">Rails 2.1.1</a> were released this week.  Both are mostly bug fixes, but checkout the changelog if you want all the details.</p>
<p>If your Rails app has alot of heavy duty <span class="caps">SQL</span> Queries you may want to take a look at a plugin by Fernando Blat called <a href="http://www.inwebwetrust.net/post/2008/09/08/query-memcached">Query memcached</a>.   This plugin overwrites Rails default query cache functionality, storing all database queries in memcached for use by sequential requests.</p>
<p>Have you ever implemented an advanced search page for a Rails application? If yes, you may have ended up with bloated controller code.  One solution to the problem is <a href="http://www.binarylogic.com/2008/9/1/searchgasm-released">Searchgasm</a> by Binary Logic which helps you do object based searching, and keep your search code clean and simple.</p>
<p>Ryan Daigle told us about some great new features in Rails Edge, including <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/9/7/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-connection-pools">Connection Pooling</a>, <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/9/7/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-shallow-routes">Shallow Routes</a>, and <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/9/7/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-mailer-layouts">Mailer Layouts</a>.  We should be getting a Rails 2.2 beta any day now, so stay tuned for that.</p>
<p>If you have any Java friends who use <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache Derby</a> who are looking to try out JRuby, Michael Galpin wrote up an <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-ad-prototype-jruby/index.html?ca=dgr-btw01os-ad-prototype-jruby&amp;S_TACT=105AGX59&amp;S_CMP=GRsitebtw01">introduction to Rails using JRuby and Derby</a>.</p>
<p>Last week Mark Imbriaco from 37 Signals put together a great blog entry and screencast which shows how they use <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1073-nuts-bolts-haproxy">HAProxy in their server setup</a>.  If you&#8217;re not familiar with the benefits of using HAProxy over the apache round robin load balancer, you need to watch his screencast.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ve started using jQuery instead of Prototype for Rails.  You might have used a plugin for this (ex. <a href="http://ennerchi.com/projects/jrails">jQuery on Rails</a>), but if you started from scratch you might have run into that problem with sending authenticity tokens with your <span class="caps">AJAX</span> requests.  Lawrence Pit posted <a href="http://blog.lawrencepit.com/2008/09/04/unobtrusive-jquery-rails/">the jQuery code you&#8217;ll need</a> to take care of this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.espace.com.eg/neverblock/">Neverblock</a> is a library that allows you to use Ruby Fibers to write non-blocking concurrent code.  This project recently released a <a href="http://www.espace.com.eg/neverblock/blog/2008/08/24/neverblock-and-activerecord-concurrent-db-access-without-threads/">non-blocking PostgreSQL adapter</a>, a <a href="http://www.espace.com.eg/neverblock/blog/2008/08/28/neverblock-mysql-support/">non-blocking MySQL adapter</a>, and most recently got their Fiber library <a href="http://www.espace.com.eg/neverblock/blog/2008/09/04/neverblock-instant-scaling-for-your-rails-apps/">running on Ruby 1.8 with Rails</a> with some amazing benchmarks!  It&#8217;s still a very young project, but it&#8217;s one more step towards a safely multi-threaded Rails stack.</p>
<p>Lastly, I&#8217;ve got some events to tell you about.  <a href="http://rubydcamp.org/">Ruby DCamp</a> is taking place October 11th-12th in Arlington, VA, the <a href="http://site.locaweb.com.br/railssummit/?language=7">Rails Summit Latin America</a> is taking place October 15th and 16 in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and the <a href="http://scrubyconf.colaruby.org/">South Carolina Ruby Conference</a> is on October 18th in Columbia, SC.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! If you would have rather listened to this information (with slightly more detail), you should check out the <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/9/10/rails-envy-podcast-episode-046-09-10-2008">Rails Envy Podcast #46</a> which came out today.  It&#8217;s no mistake that it&#8217;s covering the same material (I help with the podcast).</p>
