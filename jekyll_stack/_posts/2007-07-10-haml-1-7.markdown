<p>The <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">Haml</a> team recently announced the release of <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/release-notes">Haml 1.7</a>, which is an alternative markup system that you can use in Rails, instead of the default ERb-based markup. Version 1.7 is significantly faster than previous releases (and is almost as fast as Rails&#8217; default system, now!). There are a few other new features, too: <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/release-notes">read all about it in the release notes</a>. Great work!</p>
