<p>On January 27th, 37signals will once again be sharing insights, ideas, passion, opinions, and vision on how to build an online business in <a href="https://workshop.37signals.com/">The Getting Real Workshop</a>. We&#8217;ll be talking about the whole lifecycle including lots of thoughts on software development with or without Rails.</p>
<p>Yours truly and Jamis Buck will both be presenting and we&#8217;ve traditionally had a lot of great chats about Rails. So if you&#8217;re considering jumping on board or already have, but needs inspiration to take that somewhere, do join us in Chicago in the beginning of next year.</p>
<p><b><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</b> Sold out. All 50 seats where gone in 12 hours. That&#8217;s about 14 times as fast as last time.</p>
