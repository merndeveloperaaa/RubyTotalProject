<p><img src="/assets/2006/9/7/adobe_logo.gif" align="right" border="0" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" />Adobe&#8217;s Mike Potter brings <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/mikepotter/2006/09/announcing_the_1.html">the cherry news</a> that an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rubyonrails-ria-sdk-by-adobe/">officially-backed Rails <span class="caps">SDK</span> for Flex</a> and the rest of the company&#8217;s <span class="caps">RIA</span> suite is now available.</p>
<p>Derek Wischusen from <a href="http://flexonrails.net/">Flex on Rails</a> gives us <a href="http://flexonrails.net/?p=12">the scoop on its content</a>:</p>
<blockquote><i>Currently, the <span class="caps">SDK</span> contains a sample demonstrating: (1) Intergrating with a database, basic <span class="caps">CRUD</span>, and rails migrations. (2) Uploading and downloading files. (3) Downloading data directly from Flex and sending data to a new browser window directly from Flex. (4) a simple Directory Explorer.  The last sample uses WebORB for integrating Flex with Rails.</i></blockquote>
<p>Great news. Flash is on the fast track out its ghetto image and its exciting to see Adobe care about integration with the world around it.</p>
