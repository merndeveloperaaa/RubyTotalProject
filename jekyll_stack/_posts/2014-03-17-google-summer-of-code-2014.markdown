We're pleased to announce, Ruby on Rails has been accepted into Google Summer of Code 2014 as a [mentoring organization]. What does this mean to you? Potentially, if you're the right person, you can get **paid** to work on Rails this summer! The "right person" in this case is one who is at least 18 years old (sorry, Google's rule, not ours!) on or before April 21, 2014; a full or part-time college student; and passionate about improving Rails.

We're building a potential list of [project ideas] on a GitHub wiki, but we welcome other interesting proposals. If your proposal gets accepted, Google will pay you $5500 over the course of three months to work on the code. If you're interested, head over to the [GSoC site] and start reading about the process. Student applications can be submitted starting March 10 and the deadline is March 21.

If you're wondering what's involved in becoming a GSoC student then the [Google Student Guide] has all the details on what's expected and what you will gain from taking part. Any further questions can be directed either to the [mailing list] or to [me] directly.

What if you're not a student? You can still help out by discussing ideas on the special [mailing list] we've setup for this year's program. Or if you've got previous experience of contributing to Rails and are ready to make a strong commitment to help out the next generation of developers, you can [apply to be a mentor].

We're looking forward to working with this year's students, and expecting some outstanding contributions to Rails as a result!
