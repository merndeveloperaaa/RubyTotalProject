Hey everybody!  I've pushed Rails 3.0.8.rc3.

Hopefully this release candidate takes care of all the outstanding issues remaining.  To see what has changed between 3.0.8.rc2 and 3.0.8.rc3, check out [this link on github](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.8.rc2...v3.0.8.rc3).
If no regressions are found, I will release the final version 72 hours from now (Thursday, June 2nd around 1pm).  Please let us know if this release candidate causes any regressions from the 3.0.7 version.

I'm still getting over my cold, so I promise that next release I will return to my normal level of excitement!  ;-)
