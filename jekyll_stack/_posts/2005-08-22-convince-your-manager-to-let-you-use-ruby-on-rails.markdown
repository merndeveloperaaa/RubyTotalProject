<p>Zed Shaw has compiled a long list of suggestions on <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.rails/19332">how you can get your manager to let you use Ruby on Rails</a> for your next project. It&#8217;s full of goodies including this strategy of dealing with the ill-informed &#8216;does it scale&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote> For example, they say, &#8220;It needs to handle 500 connections/second.&#8221;  Don&#8217;t let them say &#8220;users&#8221;, &#8220;users&#8221; means nothing.  Then you go test their current WizBangOMatic and find it only handles 10 conn/second.  You can then come to them and say that Rails can&#8217;t do 500 conn/second, but it can do better than the WizBangOMatic which only has 10 conn/second performance.  It&#8217;s evil, but it puts the performance harpies at rest.</blockquote>
