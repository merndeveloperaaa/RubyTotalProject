<p>In just a few days, the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/WorkingProfessionallyWithRails">list of people working professionally with Rails</a> to earn &#8220;&#8230;a substantial or full paycheck&#8221; has blazed past 200! It includes programmers from 33 countries. From China to Finland to Jamaica to South Africa. But the United States is still the dominant force. Almost <i>half</i> of programmers on the list are living there.</p>
<p>Growing the ecosystem around Rails is very important and I&#8217;m thrilled to see the list so large already. Who dares venture a guess at the numbers in 3, 6, and 12 months?</p>
