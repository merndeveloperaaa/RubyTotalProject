<p>Alexey Verkhovsky has completed the transition of Instiki to a Rails-based core that uses the latest versions of all the framework instead of the &#8216;03 dialects it was currently running. Instiki is still powered by Madeleine, though. Which means that it&#8217;ll be some time yet before you can run Instiki on Apache or lighttpd directly as a move to Active Record or a separate Madeleine process is needed for that to happen.</p>
<p>The new version should be a lot more approachable for Rails hackers, though. And its also a pretty good case of how to use Rails with something else than a database backend. <a href="http://instiki.org/">Dig in!</a></p>
