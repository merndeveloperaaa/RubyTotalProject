<p>Hongli and crew from Phusion have been hard at work for some time to fix the ease-of-deployment issue on Apache with their Passenger project. They now have a video that demos how simple it&#8217;ll be to install and get running with mod_rails. <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Check it out</a>.</p>
