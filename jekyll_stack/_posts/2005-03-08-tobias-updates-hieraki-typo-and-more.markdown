<p>Tobias Luekte has been a busy bee lately. In his <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/articles/read/19">week worth of updates</a>, he writes about updating Hieraki and Typo to Rails 0.10 and a bunch of goodies for both in the wake of that. Additionally, he has a new scaffold generator using the postback approach and updates to both Money and the login generator. Way to go, Tobi! Keep it coming.</p>
