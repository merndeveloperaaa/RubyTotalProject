We're happy to announce Rails 5.1.0.rc1 has been released. With the help of the community we polished the Rails 5.1
release with more than [380 commits](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v5.1.0.beta1...v5.1.0.rc1).

Notably, [Stephen Touset](https://github.com/stouset) helped us up the encryption used for encrypted secrets, so you'll want to run [this script](https://gist.github.com/kaspth/bc37989c2f39a5642112f28b1d93f343)
to upgrade your app if you're already dabbling with the feature. Thanks Stephen!

While we are working to close the last issues, you can check [the Rails 5.1 releases notes](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/5_1_release_notes.html),
or the awesome summary of new features present in [the 5.1.0.beta1 blog post](https://rubyonrails.org/2017/2/23/Rails-5-1-beta1).

[Basecamp 3](https://basecamp.com) is already running this release candidate in production. Our friends at
[Heroku](https://heroku.com) prepared the platform that is now fully compatible with all those shiny new features.

As per our [maintenance policy][maintenance-policy], the release of Rails 5.1 will mean that bug fixes will only apply
to 5.1.x, regular security issues to 5.1.x and 5.0.x, and severe security issues to 5.1.x, 5.0.x, and 4.2.x.
This means 4.x and below will essentially be unsupported!

To try out this new release:

```
gem install rails -v 5.1.0.rc1
```

Make sure you are using RubyGems 2.6.11 or later before trying to install a pre release, with:

```
gem update --system 2.6.11
```

Thank you to [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins) for releasing this new version of RubyGems just in time for
our release.

Please help us test this release candidate version of Rails. It's always frustrating when we put a lot of work into a
new release, betas, release candidates, and then get people report all sorts of issues on week one of the final release.
This is an incremental upgrade to Rails 5.0. Please do your community duty and help us land a solid 5.1 without needing
an immediate 5.1.1.

Thank you!
