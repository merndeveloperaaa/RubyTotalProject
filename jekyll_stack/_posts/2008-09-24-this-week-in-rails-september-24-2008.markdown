<p>Welcome to the sixth addition of This Week in Rails, where we&#8217;ll take a look of the past two weeks of innovation in the Rails community.  If you&#8217;d rather listen to this content on your ipod with additional Ruby news, check out the <a href="http://www.RailsEnvy.com/podcast">Rails Envy Podcast</a> <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/9/17/rails-envy-podcast-episode-047-09-17-2008">#47</a> and <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/9/24/rails-envy-podcast-episode-048-09-24-2008">#48</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://guides.rails.info/">Rails Guides Hackfest</a> is in full swing, improving the Rails documentation by leaps and bounds.  <a href="http://guides.rails.info/routing/routing_outside_in.html">Rails Routing from the Outside In</a> by Mike Gunderloy is a great read if you&#8217;re ever confused by Rails Routing.  If you want to help with the Guide hackfest, there are <a href="http://guides.rails.info/">several guides</a> up that you can help review.</p>
<p>If you ever need to build a website which allows users to upload videos and then needs to encode them, definitely check out <a href="http://blog.new-bamboo.co.uk/2008/9/11/panda-open-source-video-encoding-powered-by-merb-ec2-s3-and-simpledb">Panda</a>, an open source video encoding application which uses EC2, S3, and SimpleDB. The application itself is written in Merb, but it&#8217;s designed to run separately on ec2 and can <a href="http://pandastream.com/docs/integrate_with_rails">easily integrate</a> with your rails app on the front end.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to ensure your Rails application is well written, Matt More wrote up a <a href="http://www.matthewpaulmoore.com/articles/1276-ruby-on-rails-code-quality-checklist">Rails Code Quality Checklist</a> which serves as a great guide to Rails best practices.  Also, if you need help discovering where your code might need a little re-factoring check out <a href="http://www.martyandrews.net/blog/2008/09/first_official_release_of_rood.html">Roodi</a> a new gem by Marty Andres that gives you instant feedback about your Ruby code by examining a few metrics including cyclomatic complexity, method length, bad method names, and blank blocks or loops. Lastly, if you&#8217;ve been following the &#8220;skinny controller, fat model&#8221; best practice, you may have found yourself with really fat models (not so good).  Paul Barry suggests one way to deal with this using <a href="http://paulbarry.com/articles/2008/08/30/concerned-with-skinny-controller-skinny-model">concerned_with</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re about to start a new Rails application then you might consider using <a href="http://github.com/fudgestudios/bort/tree/master">Bort</a>, a Rails starter application from Jim Neath.  Bort contains RESTful Auth, Will Paginate, Exception Notifier, Asset Packager, a Capistrano Recipe, and everything is tested by RSpec.  If you&#8217;d rather start your system with email login instead of username, Matt Hall put together a <a href="http://github.com/MattHall/bort/tree/master">fork of bort</a> for this.</p>
<p>Implementing a page with multiple file uploads in Rails is no easy task.  Luckily, Brian Getting wrote up <a href="http://www.practicalecommerce.com/blogs/post/432-Multiple-Attachments-in-Rails">a tutorial</a> which makes it look easy.</p>
<p>Clemens Kofler wrote up a <a href="http://www.railway.at/articles/2008/09/20/a-guide-to-memoization">Guide to Memoization</a> which walks through all the details of this convention and looks at the new &#8220;memoize&#8221; helper in Edge Rails ActiveSupport.  If you don&#8217;t know what this word means, please do take the time to read his tutorial.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever developed a plugin, you may have just decided to manually run your tests every time you change your code.  Last week Ken Collins recently put out a new library called <a href="http://www.metaskills.net/2008/9/19/using-autotest-for-rails-plugin-development">Autotest Railsplugin</a> which makes it dirt simple to run autotest on plugins you&#8217;re developing.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you&#8217;re looking for other Ruby/Rails podcasts, check out the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Podcast</a> which recently featured Jim Weirich at erubycon, <a href="http://www.rubyology.com/">Rubyology</a> which recently interviewed Avi Bryant, the <a href="http://www.buildingwebapps.com/podcasts">Learning Rails</a> podcast which recently covered how to deploy your rails app, <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscasts</a> which recently covered starling and workling, and the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.pro.br/">Rails Brazil Podcast</a> if you speak Portuguese.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now.  If you create or discover any notable tools or blog posts this week, feel free to send me an email (Gregg@RailsEnvy).</p>
