<p>Scott Barron is <a href="http://lunchroom.lunchboxsoftware.com/articles/2005/08/19/rcss-anyone">toying with the idea of a rcss format</a> that would allow you to specify your <span class="caps">CSS</span> file in Ruby. Why would you ever want to do that? Have a look at <a href="http://lunchroom.lunchboxsoftware.com/pages/rcss">Scott&#8217;s example</a> and note the use of variables. That&#8217;s a pretty good reason on its own.</p>
