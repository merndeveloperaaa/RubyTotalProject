<p>Matz, the creator of Ruby, has <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/rubyCommittersNowOnBasecamp.html">signed up</a> for a <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> account to help the committers team collaborate on the development of Ruby. What an honor.</p>
<p>Note, the intentions are not to use Basecamp as a ticketing system (it&#8217;s not well suited for that), but rather as tool to help the informal division of labor that&#8217;s already going on in private and on the committers mailing list.</p>
