<p>It took me a week, but dammit, I&#8217;ll trout the horn of fanfare none the less: <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/articles/2005/04/23/typo-2-0-arrives">Typo 2.0 is out!</a> Typo is that little weblogging engine that Tobias started while he was waiting for a client in a coffee shop, but which has now attracted an entire team around it. And boy, is it ever looking great!</p>
<p>It seems that I&#8217;m out of excuses for still running this blog on WordPress. I can&#8217;t wait to port it over to Typo within the foreseeable future.</p>
