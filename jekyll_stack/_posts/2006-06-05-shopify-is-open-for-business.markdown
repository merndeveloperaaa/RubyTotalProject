<p>We&#8217;re lagging the <a href="http://blog.jadedpixel.com/articles/2006/06/02/shopify-is-live">official announcement</a> by a fair margin, but that won&#8217;t hold back our official word of congratulations for Jaded Pixel as they&#8217;ve launched <a href="http://shopify.com/">Shopify</a>. It&#8217;s instant-on stores that don&#8217;t smell like a candy bar left in your pocket in the mid-90&#8217;ies. Complete with its own templating engine, Shopify makes it silly easy to create great looking stores that doesn&#8217;t just follow a cookie-cutter format.</p>
<p>In Rails circles, Jaded Pixel is mostly known as the company starring Rails Core developer Tobias L&uuml;tke. The team has already been sharing a great many extractions from the work of Shopify. So if you&#8217;ve played with the template engine <a href="http://home.leetsoft.com/liquid">Liquid</a> or installed the forum-system <a href="http://home.leetsoft.com/opinion">Opinion</a>, you&#8217;ve been touched by Shopify (now isn&#8217;t that heart warming!).</p>
<p>Once again, major props to Tobi and crew for finally delivering on this massive undertaking.</p>
