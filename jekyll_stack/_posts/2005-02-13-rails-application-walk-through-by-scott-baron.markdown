<p>Scott Baron is walking through the process of creating an application &#8220;&#8230;used by a university cable television station to manage and generate schedules for their movie channels&#8221;. He&#8217;s doing it in several installments and the first two are already available. The <a href="http://scott.elitists.net/view/7">first installment</a> describes the background and the freshly published <a href="http://scott.elitists.net/journal/view/8">second installment</a> walks through the creation of all the models in the system.</p>
<p>Scott promises that the next installment will focus on validations and unit tests and that the whole thing will be packaged as both <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">PDF</span> when its done. Great work, Scott!</p>
