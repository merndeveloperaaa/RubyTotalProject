<p>Thomas Fuchs has been doing awesome work building on top of Prototype (the Javascript engine driving Ajax in Rails) to bring us <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us: Better effects and drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop capabilities</a>. Together with the <a href="http://sean.treadway.info/articles/2005/06/22/upload-progress-stabilizing">upload progress enhancements</a> from Sean Treadway, we&#8217;re going to have a big upgrade to the Ajax capabilities of Rails in the next, forthcoming release (0.13).</p>
<p>If you want to see what&#8217;s in store for you, checkout the addition of <a href="http://backpackit.com/weblog/archives/new_features_updates/new_drag_and_drop_reordering_for_todos_and_notes.php">drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop to Backpack</a>. Shows off very nicely just how cool drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop can be in a Web 2.0 application.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more chatter about this on <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000468.html">Loud Thinking</a>, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/drag_and_drop_comes_to_backpack.php?1#comments">Signal vs Noise</a>, and <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/articles/2005/06/22/script-aculo-us-launched">mir.aculo.us</a>.</p>
