<p>The Rails wiki has returned in a trimmed form that abandoned all the previous revisions in order to make Madeleine cope with the pressure. We&#8217;ve surely pressed the backend far beyond its original, humble, personal wiki intentions. With tens of thousands of page revisions, it was just choking.</p>
<p>But have no fear. Instiki will soon be available in a database-backed version that&#8217;ll be more suitable for public wikis the size of the Rails one.</p>
