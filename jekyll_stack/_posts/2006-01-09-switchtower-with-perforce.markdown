<p>Richard McMahon has written about using Perforce as the <span class="caps">SCM</span> with SwitchTower (<a href="http://jroller.com/page/rmcmahon/?anchor=using_perforce_with_switchtower">here</a>). He&#8217;s even written a custom Perforce <span class="caps">SCM</span> module for SwitchTower, so if you&#8217;re a Perforce user wanting to dabble with SwitchTower, it looks like you&#8217;re in luck.</p>
<p>(Richard has given his permission for the Perforce <span class="caps">SCM</span> module to be included with the next SwitchTower release.)</p>
