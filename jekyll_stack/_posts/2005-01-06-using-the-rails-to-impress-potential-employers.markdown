<p>Drew McLellan is looking for a job and what better way to demonstrate to potential employers than to <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/243/">show you&#8217;re keeping up</a> with the field of web development:</p>
<blockquote>I like to work on the edge and am frequently updating my skills. Right now I&rsquo;m learning Ruby with the aim of doing some work using the Rails framework in the near future. Learning new things opens your mind to possibilities, and more possibilities lead to better solutions.</blockquote>
<p>With jobs being outsourced left and right, perhaps its also time for you to demonstrate why you&#8217;re not just yet another mainstream developer chasing the same Java, .<span class="caps">NET</span>, or <span class="caps">PHP</span> jobs as everyone else. Stand out from the crowd.</p>
