<p>Jason Hoffman from Joyent had a great tutorial at RailsConf Europe on Scaling a Rails Application from the Bottom Up. It defines the key terms and measurements of scaling and explains why scaling in essence have nothing to do with Rails. It&#8217;s a great story to have in hand when the inevitable fudzy &#8220;But does it scale?&#8221; nonsense is thrown at you.</p>
<p>Now you can get all of <a href="http://jxh.bingodisk.com/bingo/public/presentations/JHoffmanRailsConf-Berlin-Sept2007.pdf">Jason&#8217;s slides from the tutorial</a>.</p>
