Kevin Clark was written a nice piece on [things you shouldn't be doing in Rails](http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/08/30/guide-things-you-shouldnt-be-doing-in-rails). It starts with a reminder about not using various deprecated pieces of the API, and goes from there into recommendations based on Kevin's personal experience with Rails. It's worth checking out. Remember, half of knowing what to do is knowing what not to do.
