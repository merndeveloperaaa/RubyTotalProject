<p>As of a few minutes ago, <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/906aebceedb95d8caa6db6314bc90f605bdfaf2b">the first big bunch of Rails 3 changes</a> were merged back to Rails master branch in github. This represents a good deal of work by Yehuda Katz, Carl Lerche, and others. I&#8217;ll have more to say on the changes later on this week, but for now, just a quick caution: if you&#8217;re in the habit of using Edge Rails, you should likely switch to the <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commits/2-3-stable">2-3-stable</a> branch for the time being. The master branch of Rails will likely take a little while to settle back into something that can be used for anything other than getting a preview of the Rails 3 excitement.</p>
