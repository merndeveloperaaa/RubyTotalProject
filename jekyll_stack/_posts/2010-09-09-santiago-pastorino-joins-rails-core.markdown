<p>It&#8217;s my pleasure to announce that Santiago Pastorino has joined <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/core">the Rails Core group</a>. Santiago only started contributing to Rails this year, but has been on fire ever since his first patches were accepted. He&#8217;s managed to rack up <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/santiago-pastorino/commits">380 commits since the beginning of the year</a>.</p>
<p>Santiago is one of the lead developers and co-founder of <a href="http://www.wyeworks.com/">WyeWorks</a> from Montevideo, Uruguay. He started working full-time with Ruby and Rails in the middle of 2008 after years of Java development. Since early 2010 he is trying to work full-time on <span class="caps">OSS</span> and sporadically writes on <a href="http://blog.wyeworks.com/">his company&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
