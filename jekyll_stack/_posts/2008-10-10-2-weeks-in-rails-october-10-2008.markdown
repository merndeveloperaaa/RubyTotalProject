<p>Welcome to yet another edition of this Week in Rails where we summarize some of the most interesting stories of the past two weeks.  If you&#8217;d rather listen to these stories with additional detail check out the <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/podcast">Rails Envy Podcast</a> episode <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/10/1/rails-envy-podcast-episode-049-10-01-2008">#49</a> and <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/10/8/rails-envy-podcast-episode-050-10-08-2008">#50</a></p>
<p>Michael Koziarski recently <a href="http://www.koziarski.net/archives/2008/9/24/countries-and-controversies">removed country_select from edge rails</a>.  Apparently Rails was using the <span class="caps">ISO</span> 3166 Long Names standard list of countries, but some people don&#8217;t think this list is politically correct.  For instance it lists &#8220;Taiwan&#8221; as &#8220;Taiwan, province of China&#8221;.  Rather then change this one and have to deal with other debatable country names, country_select has been moved to a plugin, so you can fork your own friendlier list of countries.</p>
<p>Rails built in <span class="caps">REST</span> support is great, but if you’ve really spent time making your <span class="caps">API</span> usable, you’ve probably found that you had to make tweaks to what gets rendered to the page when a user wants xml or json.  Chris Heald wrote up <a href="http://www.coffeepowered.net/2008/09/27/powerful-easy-dry-multi-format-rest-apis/">one solution on his blog</a> this week, which shows you how to use xml builder to produce xml which gets translated for your xml, json, and maybe even yaml output formats.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself needing to add role-based authorization to your Rails app, you should check out a <a href="http://metautonomo.us/2008/09/30/easy-role-based-authorization/">blog post</a> this week by Ernie Miller.  He gives a unique  implementation worth taking a look at.</p>
<p><strong>Hosting, Performance, and Tuning</strong></p>

<p>If you use Slicehost as your <span class="caps">ISP</span> for websites, Mark Reynolds wrote up a <a href="http://blog.fiveruns.com/2008/9/24/rails-automation-at-slicehost">script</a> that will install and fully configure your slice to get up and running with Rails, Mysql, and Thin.</p>
<p>We all should probably be load testing our applications more then we do, but this isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s done easily.  Luckily our favorite Ruby Hero, Ilya Grigorik recently <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2008/09/30/load-testing-with-log-replay/">wrote up a tutorial</a> which serves as a great guide to accurately benchmarking our Rails apps.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for additional tools to help fine tune your Ruby code, Dan Mayer wrote up a <a href="http://devver.net/blog/2008/10/ruby-tools-roundup/">great overview</a> of just about everything available.</p>
<p><strong>Databases</strong></p>
<p>Alexander Lang recents wrote up a blog post entitled <a href="http://upstream-berlin.com/2008/09/25/a-couchdb-primer-for-an-activerecord-mindset/">A CouchDB primer for an ActiveRecord mindset</a>. He gives a simplified introduction to Couch db, goes over a few Ruby libraries that interface with it, and lastly introduces his new Ruby library called CouchPotato.</p>
<p>A few weeks back Rama McIntosh published a <a href="http://myutil.com/2008/8/31/rake-task-transfer-rails-database-mysql-to-postgres">really useful script</a> on his blog if you ever need to convert your application from one database to another using ActiveRecord.</p>
<p><strong>Library News</strong></p>
<p><img src="/assets/2008/10/10/libraries.png" /></p>
<p>Is your rails app pre-Rails 2.1 and you&#8217;re envious of those readable <strong>named_scope</strong> methods?  Ken Collins has <a href="http://github.com/metaskills/named_scope/tree/master">back-ported named_scope</a> to Rails 1.2.6 and 2.0.4 so you can take advantage of using this method.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using RSpec to test your Rails app, you may be interested to know that the RSpec Story Runner (where you do your integration tests) is going to be replaced by a <a href="http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/2008/9/22/cucumber">Cucumber</a>.  Although it&#8217;s typically not a good thing to be replaced by a Cucumber, this particular one is a library written by Aslak Hellesoy which should bring some increased organization and additional benefits to your integration tests.  If you want to get a head start on consuming the cucumber, then check out <a href="http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/migration-from-rspec-stories">Aslak&#8217;s blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Talking about Testing, <a href="http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2008/9/30/shoulda-2-0">Shoulda 2.0</a> was recently released witch includes a few improvements and bugfixes.  If you&#8217;d like an overview of everything Shoulda has to offer, Kyle Banker wrote up a great <a href="http://kylebanker.com/blog/2008/09/shoulda-testing-cheat-sheet/">shoulda cheat sheet</a> you should take a look at.</p>
<p>Noel Rappin, the same guy who brought you Rails iui, recently released <a href="http://www.pathf.com/blogs/2008/09/tankengine-new-plugin-for-rails-iphone-development/">TankEngine</a>, a new rails plugin for targeting the iPhone and Mobile Safari.  It uses a jQuery based javascript layer and it’s much more flexible and has better helpers then the original Rails iui.</p>
<p>Marc-Andre Cournoyer recently released <a href="http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/2008/09/30/thin-10/">Thin 1.0</a>, the ultra fast Web Server.  There’s quite a few people that have <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/users/">moved to thin</a> from mongrel in their production environments.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.toghq.com/">Tog 0.2.1</a> was recently released, which is a collection of plugins that together form a social networking app.  What&#8217;s great about Tog is that you can pick out just one plugin, like messaging, blogs, or <span class="caps">CMS</span> and bring that part into your existing Rails app.</p>
<p><a href="http://playtype.net/past/2008/10/2/workling_version_03_released/">Workling 0.3</a> was released last week, which serves as a great way to deal with background tasks in your Rails app, no matter what messaging queue service you&#8217;re using.</p>
<p>The Weather Channel provides a great <span class="caps">API</span> to pull down the current weather and forecasts around the world.  Jared Pace recently created a Gem called <a href="http://codewordstudios.com/posts/2-introducing-weatherman-a-ruby-gem">WeatherMan</a> which allows you to take full advantage of this data.</p>
<p>Jan De Poorter has recently revived the <a href="http://workswithruby.com/2008/10/railsxls-revived">RailsXLS plugin</a> which uses a java bridge and jakarata to let you use ruby to create excel spreadsheets.</p>
