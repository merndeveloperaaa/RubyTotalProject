<p>One thing that has been a continuing challenge for many Rails developers is finding a good designer to work with. There are certainly plenty of fantastic designers out there, but it&#8217;s often difficult to find one who is comfortable working directly in a Rails project.</p>
<p>In an effort to help ease this challenge, and at the behest of some interested developers and designers, the Rails Activists have set up a group for <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-graphic-designers">Ruby Graphics Designers</a>. The idea is to have a place for communication: a spot where designers can ask questions about git or erb, or where developers can try to find a designer to work with.</p>
<p>Of course, a group without participation is nothing to crow about. If you&#8217;re a developer &#8211; or especially if you&#8217;re a designer who works with Rails &#8211; we&#8217;d love to have your participation. If you&#8217;re interested in the visual design and information architecture of Rails applications, c&#8217;mon by and say hi! And if you have other ideas about how we can encourage closer collaboration between the Rails community and the design community, we&#8217;d love to hear them.</p>
