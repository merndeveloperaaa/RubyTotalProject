<p>In case you were wondering if Rails can scale:  Eric Hodel <a href="http://blog.segment7.net/articles/2006/03/06/2-5-million">reports</a> that the <a href="http://www.robotcoop.com">Robot Co-op</a> served 2,587,240 requests through their Rails applications last Saturday.</p>
<p>Do you have any scalability stories to share?</p>
