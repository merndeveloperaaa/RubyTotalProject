<p>On top of the official <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a> in Chicago in June, Rails developers are getting a second chance to get together and rejoice this year. <a href="http://www.canadaonrails.com/">Canada on Rails</a> is a two-day conference dedicated entirely to Rails and set in Vancouver, Canada for April 13th and 14th.</p>
<p>I will be there to keynote and Nathaniel is rounding up a bunch of other cool speakers to come talk about Rails. You can even <a href="http://www.canadaonrails.com/news-submit-a-talk-proposal.html">submit your own talk proposal</a> and the <a href="http://store.osevents.com/product_info.php?products_id=3">registration for conference is open too</a>. There&#8217;s an early bird special for just $175 <span class="caps">CAD</span>.</p>
<p>So check it out, yo.</p>
