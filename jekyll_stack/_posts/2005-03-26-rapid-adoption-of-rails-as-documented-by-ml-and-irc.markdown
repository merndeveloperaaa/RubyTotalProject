<p>If you should have any doubts that Rails is experiencing rapid adoption, consider this graph plotting the number of messages per day (as a raising average, high mark was 141 messages in a single day) on the mailing list:</p>

<p>On <span class="caps">IRC</span>, we&#8217;ve high-marked at 225 people and have more people than the #ruby-lang channel on most evenings.</p>
