<p>The Burton Group <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/DisplaySummary.asp?SID=1360166&amp;U=136016677100">survey of Rails origin</a> has concluded and the results are in: Half the Railers that responded came from <span class="caps">PHP</span>, one third comes from Java. A third of the 410 respondents even use Rails in &#8220;mission critical&#8221; applications. Three quarters consider Rails their primary web development tool.</p>
