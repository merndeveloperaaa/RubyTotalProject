<p>Rick Bradley shares a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.rails/24863">great case study</a> on how his team replaced a partial J2EE solution that wasn&#8217;t moving the team forward fast enough with Rails. Result? A 20:1 reduction in the amount of code needed to solve the problem.</p>
<p>And this is not Yet Another Blog, or even those luxury todo lists we do at 37signals, but a healthcare application that has to play in the regulated world of <span class="caps">HIPAA</span>, Sarbanes-Oxley, drug trial requirements, and all that other heavy-duty joy.</p>
<p>Rails takes another step deeper into The Enterprise.</p>
