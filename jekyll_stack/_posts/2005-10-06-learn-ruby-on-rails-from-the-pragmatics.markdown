<p>Dave Thomas and Mike Clark has just <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Tech/Ruby/RailsStudio.html">announced</a> the <a href="http://studio.pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Studio</a> and their intentions to run a Rails Studio as their first workshop.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be two days of action-packed Ruby on Rails training that&#8217;ll touch on all parts of the framework. If you&#8217;re skeptic about the studio only being two days and whether that&#8217;ll leave to any usable software, they reply:</p>
<blockquote> Can you really learn how to build web applications with Rails in two days? Absolutely! Now, if we were trying to teach you how to build web applications using Spring, Hibernate, and a mishmash of other J2EE technologies, you&#8217;d be away from the office for at least a week. Instead, by the end of the week you could have your Rails application up and running!</blockquote>
<p>You should hurry, though. Signup is happening rapidly for the first date on November 18-19 in Reston, VA. The price ranges from $1,000 (single person including 1-day Ruby tutorial) to $650 (part of 5+ team, just Rails).</p>
