<p>Last year, as you may recall, Rails got <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2008/8/16/josh-peek-officially-joins-the-rails-core">thread safety and a new core committer</a> thanks to our participation in the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> program under the auspices of <a href="http://rubycentral.org/">Ruby Central</a>. This year, we&#8217;re pleased to announce, Ruby on Rails has been accepted into Google Summer of Code as a <a href="http://rubycentral.org/">sponsoring organization</a> in its own right.</p>
<p>What does this mean to you? Potentially, if you&#8217;re the right person, you can get <em>paid</em> to work on the Rails core code this summer!</p>
<p>The &#8220;right person&#8221; in this case is one who is at least 18 years old (sorry, Google&#8217;s rule, not ours!), a full- or part-time college student, and passionate about improving Rails. We&#8217;re building a potential list of <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/gsoc/2009/ideas">project ideas</a> on the Rails wiki, but we welcome other interesting proposals. We&#8217;re especially interested in work that meshes well with the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3">plans for Rails 3.0</a>, which will be in full swing by the time GSoC launches. If your proposal gets accepted, Google will pay you $4500 over the course of three months to work on the code.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, head over to the <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/">GSoC site</a> and start reading about the process. Student applications can be submitted starting March 23.</p>
<p>What if you&#8217;re not a student? You can still help out by brainstorming ideas on the Rails wiki. Or if you&#8217;re a Rails guru and ready to make a strong commitment to help out the next generation of developers, you can <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/apply_mentor/google/gsoc2009">apply to be a mentor</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to working with this year&#8217;s students, and expecting some outstanding contributions to Rails as a result!</p>
