<p>For those of you in the Silicon Valley, Zachary Taylor and others are starting up a Ruby on Rails group and are looking for people interested in joining in. They don&#8217;t have any set dates for the first meeting, but are aiming for a get together in the coming weeks. If you are interested, <a href="http://ruby.meetup.com/72/t/if_2829382/?gj=ej4">get involved</a>.</p>
<p>If you are closer to San Francisco proper, you should know that they already have a group setup. The <a href="http://ruby.meetup.com/6/">SF Ruby Meetup</a>  has regular meetings on the 2nd Tuesday of the month.</p>
