<p><a href="http://www.railsconf.com">RailsConf 2010</a> is underway and what better occasion to do the final stage of the Rails 3 beta program. We&#8217;re very pleased to announce Rails 3 beta 4, which we&#8217;ll be hammering on and tuning during RailsConf.</p>
<p>At the end of RailsConf, we&#8217;ll be putting out the release candidate. So if you&#8217;re at the conference, and even if you&#8217;re not, now is the time to give upgrading a chance or even starting a new app. We&#8217;re all responsible for making this release solid, please join the fun.</p>
<p>You can install the latest beta with <code>gem install rails --pre</code></p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re so close to release now, it&#8217;s also a great pleasure to introduce <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/screencasts/rails3">the new Rails 3 screencast series</a> by Gregg Pollack and EnvyLabs. They&#8217;ve done an awesome job putting together six episodes and more are coming. You can also read along in their <a href="http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/40/The%20Rails%203%20Ropes%20Course%20Presentation.pdf">great Rails 3 slides from the RailsConf tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>I also gave a keynote on Rails 3 this morning at RailsConf, so you can <a href="https://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2010-37signals">enjoy the slides</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s race to the finish line together.</p>
