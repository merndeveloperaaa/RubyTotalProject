<p>The <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/51/register.html">registration form</a> for <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf</a> is still glowing hot after a weekend that ensured that we&#8217;re now more than half sold out for the conference! This makes RailsConf &#8216;07 the fastest selling conference that O&#8217;Reilly have been involved with.</p>
<p>If we continue with this rate, we&#8217;ll be sold out before the end of the week. That&#8217;s 1200 seats. Not too shabby for a framework not even three years old and a conference only in its second year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be an amazing festival in Portland, that&#8217;s for sure. I can&#8217;t wait to get up there and talk about Rails 2.0.</p>
