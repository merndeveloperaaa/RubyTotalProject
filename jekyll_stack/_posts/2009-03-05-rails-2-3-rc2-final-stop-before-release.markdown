<p>The past month has seen a flurry of activity getting Rails 2.3 solid. We think we&#8217;ve ironed out all the major kinks now, but just to be sure, we&#8217;re running one last release candidate before it heads off to the presses. So please take some time to test out this release candidate. If we don&#8217;t get any reports of major blockers, we&#8217;re going to call this final within a week or two.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve put together a complete guide for <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/2_3_release_notes.html">the Rails 2.3 release notes</a> with all the information on what&#8217;s new, what&#8217;s changed, and what&#8217;s deprecated.</p>
<p>You can install the release candidate with:</p>
<p><code>gem install rails --source http://gems.rubyonrails.org</code></p>
