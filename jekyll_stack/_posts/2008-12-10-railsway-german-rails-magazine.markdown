<p>If you can read German and you develop with Rails you&#8217;ll be happy to know that <a href="http://it-republik.de">it republik</a>, the same company that also produces a Java, .<span class="caps">NET</span>, and <span class="caps">PHP</span> magazine, is about to release a Ruby on Rails Magazine called <a href="http://it-republik.de/railsway/magazin-ausgaben/Ruby-on-Rails-000281.html" title="RailsWay">RailsWay</a>.</p>
<p>The magazine is in print and will be out in Germany, Switzerland and Austria by December 17, 2008. For 2009 they plan to release six issues (in the German language), and I hear they&#8217;re planning on an English version, but no <span class="caps">ETA</span> on that.  The content of the first issue includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Getting started with Ruby on Rails</li>
	<li><span class="caps">AJAX</span> and Rails</li>
	<li><span class="caps">RAILS</span> 2.2 &#8211; what&#8217;s new</li>
	<li>IDE&#8217;s for <span class="caps">RAILS</span></li>
	<li>Behaviour Driven Development</li>
	<li>Metaprogramming With <span class="caps">RUBY</span></li>
	<li>RESTFull Web Services</li>
	<li>Featured Website: Qype.com</li>
	<li>Tips, Tricks, Performance &amp; Security</li>
</ul>
<p>A <span class="caps">DVD</span> comes with the magazine which includes tutorials, videos, free rails books, and a bunch of IDEs.  The Editor in Chief is <a href="http://www.rails-experts.com/">Michael Johann</a>, who has done a great deal to promote Rails in Germany.</p>
