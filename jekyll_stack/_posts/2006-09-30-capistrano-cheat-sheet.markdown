<p>David Pettifer has created a compact Capistrano cheat sheet in <span class="caps">PDF</span> format. It summarizes helper methods, pre-defined variables, standard tasks, capfile syntax, standard release directory structure, and more. So go ahead, <a href="http://dizzy.co.uk/cheatsheets/">download it</a>!</p>
<p>(For those arriving late to the party, Capistrano is a utility for executing commands in parallel on multiple remote hosts. You can read all about it in the <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17">Capistrano manual</a>.)</p>
