<p>I&#8217;m only a week behind on the <a href="http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2006/07/22/typo-4-0-0">release of Typo 4</a>.  Typo is one of the oldest and most visible of Rails open source projects, so it&#8217;s always nice to see a new release.  Out of all the new features and bug fixes, what really stood out for me was the Typo installer.  Scott has recently extracted this into <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rails-installer/">its own gem</a>, ready for inclusion with your own Rails applications!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typo now includes a .gem-based installer that makes it easy to install Typo. Just install the Typo gem (gem install typo) and run the Typo installer (typo install /some/path) to create a new Typo blog in /some/path. The installer will install all of Typo’s files, create a working set of config files, create a SQLite database for you, and start the Mongrel web server on a random <span class="caps">TCP</span> port. It’ll also create a set of sample Apache and Lighttpd configuration files to show you how to tie Typo into your existing web server. &#8212; <a href="http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2006/07/23/typo-installer">Typo Installer</a></p>
