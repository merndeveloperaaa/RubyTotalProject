<p><a href="http://mediacast.sun.com/">Sun&#8217;s Mediacast</a> site is now running JRuby on Rails as their production stack. As <a href="http://blog.igorminar.com/2008/01/jruby-on-rails-rewrite-of.html">Igor Minar tells</a>, this is definitely still early days for the JRuby/Rails pair, but none the less they have a finished site running off sun.com. Congratulations, guys!</p>
