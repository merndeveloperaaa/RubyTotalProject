<p>Joyent&#8217;s <a href="http://developers.joyent.com/">Slingshot technology</a> for creating offline-capable Rails applications has gone public. They&#8217;re even doing a <a href="http://developers.joyent.com/wiki/SlingshotPortContest">competition to celebrate</a>: The best ports of various open source Rails applications can win a 1-year big Accelerator ($1250 value). Now there&#8217;s a project you can hack on the plane to Portland in a few weeks ;).</p>
