<p>37signals has announced two upcoming products: <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/campfire_on_deck_from_37signals.php?102#comments">Campfire</a> and <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/sunrise_37signals_crm_tool_for_small_business_is_coming_soon.php?57#comments">Sunrise</a>. This is significant for Rails development because all 37signals applications has historically been the main source for new features in Rails.</p>
<p>Sunrise has already spawned a good number of features for 1.1. There are the polymorphic associations and join model support as well as form_for/fields_for. See the <a href="http://media.rubyonrails.org/presentations/pursuitofbeauty.pdf">Pursuit of Beauty presentation</a> for code examples on those. Campfire is pushing the envelope on <span class="caps">RJS</span> (more on that later).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try to make the connection between new features in Rails and their origin in 37signals applications to make their usage more clear. Stay tuned.</p>
