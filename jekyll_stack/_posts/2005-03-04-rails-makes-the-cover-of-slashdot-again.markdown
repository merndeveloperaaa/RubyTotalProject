<p>There&#8217;s nothing like an O&#8217;Reilly article to get you <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/04/1319242">on the cover of Slashdot</a>. Curt Hibbs is once again the man for writing a great article that boosts awareness about Rails in the process. Once again, welcome Slashdotters!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a happy Rails user, you might want to consider hanging out in the comments and helping others find the resources they need. Perhaps even throw a testimonial in there, if you&#8217;re really Rails happy ;)</p>
