<p>Now that you&#8217;ve made it out of the ghetto and joined the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/WorkingProfessionallyWithRails">hundreds of professional Rails programmers</a> making a living enjoying your work life, you&#8217;ll need an invoice system to match. <a href="http://www.blinksale.com/">Blinksale</a> might just be what you need. It&#8217;s a snazzy Ruby on Rails application by Firewheel Design that follows the 37signals school of design with less software and developed under strong inspiration from the Get Real process.</p>
