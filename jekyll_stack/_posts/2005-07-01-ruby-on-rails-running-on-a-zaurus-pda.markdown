<p>From our Japanese friends comes a great series of pictures showing <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/thata/20050616#1118894921">Ruby on Rails running on the Zaurus <span class="caps">PDA</span></a>! Rails has gone mobile, baby. That&#8217;s pretty darn cool. In a way trivial as it&#8217;s &#8220;just Linux&#8221;, but I&#8217;m impressed regardless.</p>
