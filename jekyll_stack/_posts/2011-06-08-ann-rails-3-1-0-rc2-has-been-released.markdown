# Security Issues!

This release contains fixes for possible XSS problems in your rails application.  It is unlikely that your application is vulnerable, but you should take precautions by updating your application.

For more information about the XSS issue that was fixed in this release, please [read this blog post](https://rubyonrails.org/2011/6/8/potential-xss-vulnerability-in-ruby-on-rails-applications).
