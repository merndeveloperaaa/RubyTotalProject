<p>We&#8217;ve recently decided to put some work into Rails documentation. We&#8217;d like to flesh out the existing docs, add documentation for the corners that are lacking and update what may have gone stale.</p>
<p><a href="http://glu.ttono.us/">Kevin Clark</a> is leading up this campaign and would like to get the help of the community at large.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s got a write up that goes over how you can help <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/05/10/documenting-rails">Documenting Rails</a> . It summarizes what we are looking for and gives basic instructions to get those who are interested in helping up and running. The main guidelines are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Write to teach</li>
	<li>Provide examples</li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t restate the obvious</li>
</ul>
<p>Good documentation patches are right up there with good code patches. If you&#8217;d like to help out Rails while gaining a deeper  understanding of how it works, taking part in this documentation project would be a great start.</p>
