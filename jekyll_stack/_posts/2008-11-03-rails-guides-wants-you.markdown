<p>If you haven&#8217;t looked at the state of Rails documentation lately, it&#8217;s time to look again. The new <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails Guides</a> page includes 14 separate guides for Rails developers, with topics ranging from &#8220;Getting Started&#8221; to routing, security, testing, and debugging. That&#8217;s over 70,000 words of help content for Rails users that didn&#8217;t exist two months ago when we launched the <a href="http://hackfest.rubyonrails.org/guide">Rails Guides project</a>.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re not done yet! We&#8217;re starting phase 2 of the Guides project, and planning a fresh batch of content to add to what&#8217;s already there. Our goal is to have a single page where you can find all of the information you need to be an effective Rails developer. Remember, though: this is open source. That means we want <em>your</em> help too!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you can do to get involved:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Read about the process of and rewards for contributing on the <a href="http://hackfest.rubyonrails.org/guide">Hackfest page</a>.</li>
	<li>Check the list of <a href="http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/16213-rails-guides/tickets?q=state%3Aavailable">available tickets</a> in our Lighthouse project, and sign up to write a guide.</li>
	<li>Submit corrections, suggestion, bugs, or patches for the existing guides. You&#8217;ll find a link to the relevant Lighthouse ticket at the bottom of each guide.</li>
	<li>Let us know what other guides you think should be added &#8211; whether you want to write them, or just hope that someone else will. Just leave a note in the comments here and we&#8217;ll get your idea into the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#8217;ll usually find some of the documentation team hanging around in #docrails on <span class="caps">IRC</span>. Come join us and help the community!</p>
