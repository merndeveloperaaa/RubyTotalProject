<p>Threat level orange, guys! The release candidate for Rails 2.1 is drawing awfully close, so if you&#8217;ve been sitting on a patch that just must make it in now is the time to rise hell or high water to make it so. Once we cut the release candidate, we&#8217;ll be loathe to introduce anything but bug fixes to the features already there.</p>
<p>So get in your saddle, cowboy, and make that patch happen. Remember that the party has moved to <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails">Github</a> and <a href="http://rails.lighthouseapp.com">Lighthouse</a>. Giddiyap!</p>
