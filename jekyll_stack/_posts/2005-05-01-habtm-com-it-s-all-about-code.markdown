<p>Courtenay is <a href="http://habtm.com/">blogging about Rails</a> at habtm.com (awesome domain name, geek points for spotting the connection). Lots of people are blogging about Rails, though, and I welcome them all. What&#8217;s somewhat special about Courtenay&#8217;s blog is that it focuses especially on posting useful snippets. When he figures out how to do something neat in Rails, there&#8217;s a snippet. Great work, keep it up!</p>
