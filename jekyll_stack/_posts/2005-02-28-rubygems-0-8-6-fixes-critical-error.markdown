<p>So now that you just upgraded to RubyGems 0.8.5, please do so again to 0.8.6. The 0.8.5 version contained a bad bug that would render the rails command to create a new skeleton setup useless. Thankfully, the process is even easier than last time. Just one command: <code>gem update --system</code>.</p>
