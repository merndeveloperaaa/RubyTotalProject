<p>Johan S&oslash;rensen has put together a great guide for <a href="http://theexciter.com/archives/2005/02/09/installing-lighttpd-1310-on-osx/">getting lighttpd 1.3.10 running on OS X</a>. All the steps needed to have lighttpd serving a <span class="caps">FCGI</span>-powered application. This is particularly exciting now since the next version of Rails will be even better suited for running on lighttpd through the introduction of Routing.</p>
