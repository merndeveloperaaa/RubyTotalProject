<p>We&#8217;ve taken our first release step towards the final version of Rails 3.1 today with the unveiling of beta 1. This is a release mostly for people who&#8217;ve already been following along with the development of Rails 3.1 and want to try a version that&#8217;s close to feature complete.</p>
<p>We do not yet have all the documentation ready, so it&#8217;s still a bit of a detective job to figure out how it all fits together. Thus, this is not a general release and I wont hold it against you if you&#8217;re holding out for a release candidate (coming in the next few weeks).</p>
<p>The tag is <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/v3.1.0.beta1">3.1.0.beta1</a> and you can install using <code>gem install rails --pre</code>. Enjoy!</p>
