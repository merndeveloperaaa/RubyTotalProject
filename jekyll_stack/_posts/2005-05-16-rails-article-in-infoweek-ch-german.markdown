<p>Jens-Christian Fischer has written an <a href="http://blog.invisible.ch/archives/000410.html">article about Ruby on Rails</a> for <a href="http://www.infoweek.ch/">Infoweek.ch</a> and they&#8217;ve granted him permission to distribute the <a href="http://blog.invisible.ch/IW09_Schwerpunkt_Ruby.pdf"><span class="caps">PDF</span></a> of it from his blog. It&#8217;s all in German, which isn&#8217;t my strongest side, but it looks very nice. Great work, Jens-Christian.</p>
