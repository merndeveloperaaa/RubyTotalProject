<p>When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Perens">Bruce Perens</a> first showed up at the #rubyonrails <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel, we were honored by his presence. Bruce is a thought leader on free and open source software and the series editor of <a href="http://phptr.com/promotions/promotion.asp?promo=1484&amp;redir=1&amp;rl=1">Bruce Perens&#8217; Open Source Series</a> from Prentice Hall. He&#8217;s also an avid Ruby on Rails convert and asked me to post this endorsement here:</p>
<blockquote>In 1981, when I started working on Unix, I remember being blown away by the power of the command-line pipes-and-filters paradigm. You could get real work done with simplicity, clarity, and economy of notation that wasn&#8217;t available in anything else at the time. I&#8217;ve worked with lots of programming environments since then, but none of them gave me that feeling of being able to write a solution so well that working code just flew off of my fingers. Until now: Ruby on Rails achieves for web programming the same sort of conceptual leap that Unix made for file-handling. You&#8217;ve got to try it!</blockquote>
<p>As one who rarely misses an opportunity to tout the Rails horn, this is almost too kind. Thanks so much, Bruce!</p>
