<p>Always wanted to bask in the glory of being a Rails contributor? Mike Gunderloy has compiled a <a href="http://afreshcup.com/2008/10/27/contributing-to-rails-step-by-step/">12-step program</a> to get you there from square. It&#8217;s never to late to get started. According to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core/browse_thread/thread/7554c8c5a25b4765">some calculations</a>, we&#8217;ve already had some 1,400 different people contribute.</p>
