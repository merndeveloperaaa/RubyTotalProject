Hi everybody.

I'd like to announce that Rails 3.2.13.rc2 has been released.

Rails 3.2.13.rc2 contains fixes for regressions found in rc1.  Please test out
rc2.  If you find regressions between 3.2.13.rc2 and 3.2.12, please email [the
rails-core mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-core), or [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new).

If there aren't any major regressions, 3.2.13 final will be released on March
13, 2013.
