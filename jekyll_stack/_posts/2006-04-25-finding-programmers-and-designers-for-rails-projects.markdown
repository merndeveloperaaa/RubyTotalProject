<p>The <a href="http://jobs.37signals.com/">Signal vs Noise Job Board</a> is a new alternative for finding good programmers and designers to work on Rails projects (among other things). It puts your job pitch in front of the tens of thousands of people reading the Signal vs Noise weblog. It comes at a price of $250 for a posting of 500 words visible for 30 days.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CNET</span>, Fleck, and NYTimes.com are all using it to advertise developers with Ruby and Rails experience. If you&#8217;re just looking for programming positions, you can subscribe to the <a href="http://jobs.37signals.com/categories/2/jobs;rss"><span class="caps">RSS</span> for the programming section</a>.</p>
<p>As you might have noticed from the URLs, this job site is using the new <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/plugins/simply_restful">Simply Restful</a> plugin. Our playground for RESTful living on Rails.</p>
