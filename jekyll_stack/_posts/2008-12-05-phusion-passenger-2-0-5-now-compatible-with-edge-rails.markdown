<p>The Phusion team keeps blazing ahead with <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a> and improving it rapidly. They&#8217;ve just <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/2008/12/05/phusion-passenger-205-released-mentioned-on-live37signalscom/">released version 2.0.5</a>, which includes a few fixes and introduces compatibility with the Rack-based Edge Rails.</p>
<p>At 37signals, we&#8217;ve already switched over <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/">Ta-da List</a> and are busy working on getting the rest of our suite running on Passenger. It&#8217;s just so much easier to deal with and the memory savings you get through <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/"><span class="caps">REE</span></a> are a nice cherry on top.</p>
<p>I keep getting a steady stream of success reports from all over the world as well. I&#8217;ve even read of a few people getting back into Rails development because Passenger finally took out the inconvenience of deploying.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to argue with the usability. I&#8217;ve personally been setting up a new server running Ubuntu 8.10 and using Apache 2 with Passenger. The time it took me to go from a fresh install to a complete production setup was ridiculously low. There&#8217;s just so much less to worry about.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t given Passenger a chance yet, now is definitely the time.</p>
