<p>Robby Russell has <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8274">interviewed Derek Sivers and Jeremy Kemper</a> about the Rails rewrite of CDBaby.com for O&#8217;Reilly. A choice bit from Derek:</p>
<blockquote>I was already studying Martin Fowler&#8217;s books like a schoolboy, ingesting the lessons while preparing for the rewrite. Then when Tobi really showed me Rails I got it : by sticking with Rails&#8217; conventions, I would be already working by these best-practices I was aspiring towards.</blockquote>
