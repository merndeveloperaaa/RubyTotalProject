<p>The $100 early-bird discount lasts until April 10th, but it seems like the open seats might not. So if you&#8217;re looking to meet up with the rest of the Rails community in Portland, you probably better <a href="https://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/register">get your registration</a> in and your travel plans in line. It&#8217;s going to be a blast.</p>
