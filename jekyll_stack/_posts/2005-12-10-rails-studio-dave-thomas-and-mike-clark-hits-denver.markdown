<p>The first <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Rails Studio</a> was a sell-out, run-away success, so naturally Dave Thomas and Mike Clark are up for it again. This time they&#8217;re hitting Denver, Colorado from January 19th through 21st. So if you&#8217;d like to learn Rails from two of the best instructors in the business, <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/#Register">sign up today</a>. They might not have seats for you next week!</p>
