<p>The new and revitalized <a href="http://newwiki.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Wiki</a> launched about two weeks ago, so it&#8217;s time for a progress report back to the Rails community. The short answer: things are going well. We&#8217;ve had nearly a hundred edits, dozens of topics put in place, and an active discussion on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-wiki">wiki mailing list</a>. Translators are already at work making the wiki content available in multiple languages. For topics ranging from a first Rails application walkthrough to handling timezones, the new wiki is already a spot to go for quality Rails content.</p>
<p>The wiki team has applied lessons learned from the old Rails wiki, which has gone from being a comfortable spot to find out a few things to a cluttered mess over the years. They started out by defining an overall structure and figuring out what warranted coverage in the wiki. Then they protected a few pages from edits and set up a login system to encourage accountability. The result, so far, is a very promising start at an information resource that can benefit all Rails developers.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s plenty more to do. If you take a look at the <a href="http://newwiki.rubyonrails.org/">new wiki home page</a> you&#8217;ll find a bunch of topics in red with dashed underlines. Those are topics that we want, but that no one has written yet. If you have a few minutes to give back to the community, why not drop by? Whether it&#8217;s drafting a new topic from scratch, revising an existing topic to be more clear or correct, adding links to high-quality external resources, or translating the wiki into another language, there&#8217;s plenty left to do &#8211; and just about every Rails developer should be able to contribute.</p>
