<p>Ah, Portland. The open-source motherland. Pacific springtime beauty. <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf &#8217;07</a> nirvana.rb # =&gt; true and home of <a href="http://cdbaby.com/">CD Baby</a>, a little record store that digs Ruby and Rails.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re gearing up for a RailsConf hackfest at the <a href="http://jupiterhotel.com">Jupiter hotel</a> just down the street and figured, heck, let&#8217;s start now! The top twenty Rails contributors between the new year and conference registration opening day will have a free conf pass and a room at the Jupiter specially reserved, CD Baby&#8217;s treat.</p>
<p>No kidding. Registration opens in a matter of weeks. <strong>Sprint!</strong></p>
<p>Rails contribution is measured by real Trac activity weighted in favor of well-tested, committed patches but also accounts for new tickets and even comments. We&#8217;re joining forces with <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/">Working With Rails</a> to <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/contests/hackfest2007">track Rails contributions</a> from the new year onward. To be included, mark yourself as a core contributor and give your <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/login">Trac username</a> in your <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/my">account profile</a>.</p>
<p>Have a Rails itch you&#8217;ve longed to scratch?  Now&#8217;s the time!  Happy hacking, and see you at RailsConf.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/01/cd_baby_awards_free_railsconf.html">Derek @ CD Baby&#8217;s announcement</a> with more details.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I announced contest close on the opening day of registration but Derek announced an earlier deadline on January 22nd. Sorry for the confusion! To draw a reasonable compromise, <strong>the contest closes tonight, January 24th, at midnight <span class="caps">PST</span></strong>. (That&#8217;s 2007-01-25 08:00:00 <span class="caps">UTC</span>.) After the contest closes, we&#8217;ll continue scoring the backlog of patches submitted before the deadline then announce the winners this weekend.</p>
<p>So far, 258 participants have opened 443 tickets, submitted 501 patches, and made 2976 changes. Congratulations! And the <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/contests/hackfest2007">leaderboard&#8217;s still tight with 17 hours to go..</a></p>
