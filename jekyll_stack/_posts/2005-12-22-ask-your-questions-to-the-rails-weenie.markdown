<p>Rick Olson has a great service running for people with questions about Rails development. The site is called <a href="http://rails.techno-weenie.net/">Rails Weenie</a> and allows you to ask questions to the community in a weblog-style fashion and then receive responses as comments. There&#8217;s already a lot of good content on there.</p>
