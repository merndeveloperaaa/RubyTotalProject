<p>It&#8217;s finally official: <a href="http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/leopard/more.html">Ruby on Rails will ship with the next version of OS X</a> (see &#8220;Internet and Web&#8221;). Both server and client (on the developer <span class="caps">DVD</span>). We&#8217;ve been working with Apple for quite a while to make this happen and its great to finally be able to share it with the world. The love for Ruby has definitely spread inside Apple and we&#8217;ve been thrilled to see the level of interest they&#8217;ve taken to get OS X to be a premiere development and deployment platform for Rails.</p>
<p>The developer seed that was distributed today at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/"><span class="caps">WWDC</span></a> contains Ruby 1.8.4 and Rails 1.1.2, but we fully expect to have Rails 1.2.x along with Mongrel, SQLite bindings, and lots of other Ruby goodies on the final gold master when it goes out in spring.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been no secret that Apple is held in very high regard by the Rails community. Every single Rails Core contributer is running on Apple and the vast majority of Rails developers are too. To see Apple acknowledge this and return the favor is very rewarding.</p>
<p>Thanks so much to Ernest Prabhakar, Jordan Hubbard, and Dave Morin for making this happen.</p>
