Google has announced the [accepted projects] for the Summer of Code 2013 and Rails has been granted five slots. Here's what our students will be working on this summer:

[Genadi Samokovarov] will be working on adding a web-based console for development, debugging and testing your Rails applications. He will be mentored by Rails Core Team member Guillermo Iguaran.

[Łukasz Strzałkowski] will be working on seperating Action View from Action Pack and adding support for custom view classes. He will be mentored by Piotr Sarnacki, who was a Rails Summer of Code student in 2010 and has been a consistent contributor to Rails.

[Ujjwal Thaakar] will be working on adding support to Rails for bulk/collection actions with RESTful resources. He will be mentored by Rails Core Team member Andrew White.

[Kasper Timm Hansen] will be working on replacing the venerable html-scanner in the Rails HTML Sanitization API with Loofah and adding improvements to the API. He will be mentored by Rails Core Team member Rafael França.

[John Wang] will be working on refactoring the configuration and initialization of Rails applications. He will be mentored by Rails Core Team member Santiago Pastorino.

We'd like to thank all of the students and mentors who participated in the Summer of Code selection process - it was tough to get down to five projects, considering all the great proposals we had. We're looking forward to seeing what all of our students bring to Rails this summer and we hope not to lose touch with others who are also excited about the prospects for Rails 4.0.
