<p>GodBit has an <a href="http://godbit.com/article/scott-raymond-interview">interview with Scott Raymond</a> about his use of Ruby on Rails in Blinksale and IconBuffet. I particularly enjoyed this bit about the opinionated software:</p>
<blockquote><i> If you pay attention when you&rsquo;re using Rails, you can hear its authorial voice. The Rails community calls the notion &ldquo;opinionated software,&rdquo; and people either love it or hate it. I love it. For me, working on Rails is sort of like having really smart, like-minded coworkers. It is inspiring, motivating and energizing. </i></blockquote>
