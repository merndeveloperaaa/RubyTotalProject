<p>Despite the book being <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">available in <span class="caps">PDF</span> form and as a bundle</a> from the publisher directly, Amazon is still ringing up a bunch of orders for the forthcoming Agile Web Development with Rails book. It&#8217;s currently floating comfortable at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/097669400X/qid=1122321424/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_sbs_1/102-5581115-0434515?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">a sales rank in the 23xx&#8217;s</a>. For comparison, Dave&#8217;s other Ruby book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0974514055/qid=1122321424/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_sbs_2/102-5581115-0434515?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">at 27xx</a>. How&#8217;s that for winning twice.</p>
