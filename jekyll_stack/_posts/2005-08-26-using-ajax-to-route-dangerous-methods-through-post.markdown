<p>Jarkko Laine has a <a href="http://jlaine.net/blog/73/using-rails-ajax-helpers-to-create-safe-state-changing-links">tutorial up on how to use Ajax to do deletes</a> and other dangerous methods through <span class="caps">POST</span> instead of <span class="caps">GET</span>. So you can sleep safe at night and not fear that the Google Web Accelerator boogeyman comes to get you.</p>
