Hi there. This is [Wojtek](https://twitter.com/morgoth85) bringing you goodies from the Rails world.

### [Document multiple databases](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36389)

Gives a great overview of available multiple database features coming in Rails 6.

### [Mirror direct uploads](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36312)

Tells the mirror service to copy the blob from the primary service to any secondary service where it doesnâ€™t already exist.

### [Fix preloading on ActiveRecord::Relation](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36429)

Fixes a case where records are duplicated by a join by using a less known _Hash_ method _compare\_by\_identity_.

### [Improve on_rotation in MessageEncryptor](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36270)

Allow _on\_rotation_ option in _MessageEncryptor_ to be passed in constructor.

### [Make rescues layout responsive](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36306)

Debugging on small devices got a lot easier by adjusting default errors layout. Check the pull request for sample image.
