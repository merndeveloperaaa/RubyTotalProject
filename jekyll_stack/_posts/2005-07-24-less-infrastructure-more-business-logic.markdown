<p>David from Canada is working on &#8220;&#8230;a web application to support restaurant/pub/bar managers in their efforts to schedule staff efficiently&#8221; using Ruby on Rails. He <a href="http://david.goodlad.ca/articles/2005/07/24/current-project">recounts his experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Rails, and the Ruby language, gets completely out of my way.  It lets me devote nearly all of my brain power to the business problem that I am trying to solve, rather than how to solve it in the language/framework/tool that I&rsquo;m using.  Instead of worrying about how to implement user logins and access control, database access, and other problems that, frankly, add nearly <em>no value</em> to the customer, I am able to focus on <em>solving their problems</em>.  This is where Rails has really shone for me.</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> book tries to get across too. Ruby on Rails brings you closer to the customer and her business concerns because there&#8217;s just so much less boring infrastructure to busy your mind with.</p>
