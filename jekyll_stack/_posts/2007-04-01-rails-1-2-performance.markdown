<p><a href="http://railsexpress.de/blog/">Stephan Kaes</a>, our resident performance expert, has released a <a href="http://railsexpress.de/blog/articles/2007/04/01/new-railsbench-release-0-9-2">new version of RailsBench</a>.  He then created new <a href="http://railsexpress.de/blog/articles/2007/04/01/rails-1-2-performance">Rails 1.2 vs Rails 1.1 benchmarks</a>, discovering that things aren&#8217;t as bad as they seem.  Of course, those numbers won&#8217;t mean a whole lot until you read the <a href="http://railsexpress.de/blog/files/reports/rails1.1-stable_vs_rails1.2-stable/report.html">full report</a></p>
