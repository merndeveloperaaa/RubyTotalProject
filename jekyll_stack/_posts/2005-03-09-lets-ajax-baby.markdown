<p>Just a heads-up. Honey, the next application from <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a>, is using a lot of <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax techniques</a> to get a spiffy and responsive interface. I&#8217;m already well underway in the process of refining the techniques and they&#8217;re just about ripe for extraction into Rails. Before Rails go 1.0, it&#8217;ll be the framework with the easiest support for Ajax on the block.</p>
