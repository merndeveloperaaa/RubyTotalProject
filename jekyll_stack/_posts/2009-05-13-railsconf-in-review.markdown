<p>Railsconf wrapped up last week, and I think we all survived Vegas.  If you weren&#8217;t able to make the conference, there is plenty of video, slides, and blog entries to get a taste of what went on.</p>
<p>First up you can get a summary of the conference by checking out my <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2009/5/13/railsconf-video-2">Railsconf in 34 minutes video</a>.  Thanks to O&#8217;Reilly you can also <a href="http://railsconf.blip.tv/posts?view=archive&amp;nsfw=dc">watch all the keynotes</a>, the <a href="http://railsconf.blip.tv/file/2089905/">Rails Core panel</a>, the <a href="http://railsconf.blip.tv/file/2082207/">Women in Rails</a> panel, and the <a href="http://railsconf.blip.tv/file/2086061/">Ruby Heroes Award Ceremony</a>.  I also put together a few videos during the conference which were played before the Keynotes (<a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2009/5/5/railsconf-2009-tutorials-day">Tutorial Day</a>, <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2009/5/6/railsconf-2009-tuesday">Tuesday</a>,  <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2009/5/8/railsconf-2009-wednesday">Wednesday</a>, and a demo of <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2009/5/11/rubystein-ruby-meets-wolfenstein">Rubystein</a> thanks to the guys from <a href="http://phusion.nl/">Phusion</a>).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for written material, the slides are <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/proceedings">available online</a> and you can find a great <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/content/news-coverage">list of blogs here</a> which covered the event.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the sessions at the conference weren&#8217;t recorded, but we&#8217;re really <a href="http://www.railsinside.com/events/288-petition-we-think-railsconf-sessions-should-be-recorded-properly.html">hoping</a> that this is the last year that happens.</p>
