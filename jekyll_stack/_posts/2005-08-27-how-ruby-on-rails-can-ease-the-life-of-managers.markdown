<p>Justin Gehtland examines <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs/?p=62">five benefits of Ruby on Rails to managers</a>. He believes that not only does Rails change the game for developers, it also holds a significant impact on their managers. It includes a good argument for <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000407.html">why Rails isn&#8217;t pursuing high-level components</a>:</p>
<blockquote>I just mean to say that not everything needs to be reusable. And it has been my experience that teams can actually move faster on most web projects starting from scratch with Rails than trying to cobble together existing components of some other platform.</blockquote>
<p>Lots of managers have already taken the shift that Rails brings to heart. Gehtland&#8217;s article help explain why that&#8217;s happening and why more of it will.</p>
