<p>Many Rails developers are perfectly happy working on their code in a text editor &#8211; and there are certainly plenty of excellent text editors out there. But others, particularly those who have come to Rails from another platform, find themselves wanting a full integrated development environment. For the latter group of developers, there&#8217;s good news: two major cross-platform Rails IDEs have releases available now.</p>
<p>Aptana&#8217;s <a href="http://aptana.com/rails">RadRails</a> (a plugin for their <a href="http://aptana.com/studio">Aptana Studio</a> <span class="caps">IDE</span>) has just released version 1.2. This Eclipse-based environment will seem instantly familiar to many users, and version 1.2 has a couple of major advances to boast about. First, it includes a wizard that will aid new users in setting up Ruby, Gems, and Rails; this is likely to be especially useful to those coming to Rails on Windows. Second, it has built-in deployment to Aptana&#8217;s <a href="http://aptana.com/cloud">Cloud Connect</a> scalable deployment service, giving a pain-free way to get your Rails applications up and running.</p>
<p>Also worth a look is JetBrains&#8217; <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/index.html">RubyMine</a>, currently in late beta prior to its commercial release. A purpose-built Rails <span class="caps">IDE</span>, it offers a variety of features including rake support, a model diagrammer, built-in web previews, and code quality tools. RubyMine isn&#8217;t finished yet, but the current beta version is showing good promise.</p>
<p>Both RadRails and RubyMine have the features you&#8217;d expect from an <span class="caps">IDE</span>, including flexible code editors, refactoring support, built-in hooks for test running, integrated debugging, and source code integration. RadRails comes in both community and $99 Pro editions, while RubyMine is scheduled to be released at $99. Whether you prefer to work in a text editor or an <span class="caps">IDE</span>, the appearance of these applications is yet another sign of the continuing popularity and growth of the Rails ecosystem.</p>
