<p>A star is rising as an alternative, lighter-weight web server that doesn&#8217;t start with an A and ends with &#8216;pache. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net">lighttpd</a> and they actually maintain their FastCGI bindings, which makes them a promising future heir to the crown of Rails Favorite Application Server.
