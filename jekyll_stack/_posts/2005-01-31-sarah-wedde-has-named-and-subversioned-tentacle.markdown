<p>The weblogging system powering Sarah Wedde&#8217;s ever funny <a href="http://onebefore.org/">One Before</a> has been baptized <a href="http://sarahwedde.org/tentacle/">Tentacle</a> and made <a href="http://sarahwedde.org/svn/tentacle/trunk/">available through <span class="caps">SVN</span></a>. I didn&#8217;t even know. Yet another example for people to learn from or use as a base for their own weblog on Rails. Thanks, Sarah.</p>
