<p>Tim Case has recently launched <a href="http://theverbalizer.com">theVerbalizer</a>. It&#8217;s a learning tool for getting into Portuguese using a method of remembering verbs as the prime driver. Very cool stuff. Especially so for me as I&#8217;ll be going to Brazil next week for the International Free Software Forum to present about Ruby on Rails.</p>
