<p><a href="http://www.strongspace.com/about"><img src="http://media.strongspace.com/screenshots/dashboard_thumb.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px"></a><a href="http://www.strongspace.com/">Strongspace</a> is a smashing new Rails-powered service from TextDrive. Their pick-up line goes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Strongspace is a secure place to gather, store, back-up and share any type of file with your co-workers, friends and family. You can upload, download and manage your files over <span class="caps">SFTP</span> (Secure <span class="caps">FTP</span>) or with any modern web browser.</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a place in the sky without all the overhead of maintaining a real hosting environment for it. Just targeted space at great prices. They start at $8/month for 4 gigabytes of space. It&#8217;s a perfect fit for Basecamp space too. They even have a movie showing how easy it is to <a href="http://media.strongspace.com/basecamp.mov">setup your Basecamp account to use Strongspace</a>.</p>
<p>The application itself is also wonderfully designed and delivered by the Rails&#8217; team at TextDrive consisting of Michael Koziarski, Marten Veldthuis, Johan S&ouml;rensen, and Justin French. Congratulations on the launch, guys.</p>
