<p>Come May 17th, the Oregon Convention Center in Portland will host <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">the second annual RailsConf</a> and if you want to be there, you better get your registration in early. Last year the 600 seats were gone in a week and change.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve doubled capacity this year, but the growth of Rails has shot up even faster than that. So if you want to be sure not to miss out, I&#8217;d advise you skip reading the rest of this introduction and jump straight to <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/51/register.html">the registration form</a>.</p>
<p>This year we&#8217;ve teamed up with O&#8217;Reilly to produce the conference, which means that silly-nilly details like which <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/51/sessions.html">sessions will be available</a> are actually ready for you to peruse before signing up. This goes for the new-to-this-year <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/51/tutorials.html">first day of tutorials</a> too. What a luxury treat. And on top of sessions and tutorials, we&#8217;ll of course also have a slew of keynotes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be one heck of a show. I can&#8217;t wait to see your all there.</p>
