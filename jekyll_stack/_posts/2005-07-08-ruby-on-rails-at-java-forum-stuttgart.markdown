<p>Thomas Baustert and Ralf Wirdemann are working on <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/03/15/web-entwicklung-mit-ruby-on-rails/">the German book</a> for Ruby on Rails and they&#8217;re also spreading the word around the country. Two days ago they did the <a href="http://www.java-forum-stuttgart.de/">Java Forum Stuttgart</a>, which is a gathering of some 800 Java programmers. Ralf summarizes the feedback:</p>
<blockquote>Our presentation was also well attended by more than 100 people. We got excellent feedback and many developers were impressed about the simplicity and less code of Rails application.</blockquote>
<p>Very nice. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if a similar reaction will be had at <span class="caps">JAOO</span> when <a href="http://www.jaoo.dk/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=54">I enter the lion&#8217;s cave</a>.</p>
