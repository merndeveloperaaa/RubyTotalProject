<p>Dan Sketcher from Tangelix is looking for a Rails developer to help them build a book engine down under:</p>
<blockquote>We&#8217;re looking for someone in Brisbane, Australia who&#8217;s keen on Rails and has a bit of experience with it, along with PostgreSQL, <span class="caps">XML</span>, and general web programming. We&#8217;ve got a booking engine to build &#8211; which we&#8217;ve had experience with before. It&#8217;s not simple, but it&#8217;s a known domain with a solid user requirements spec and sitemap that will be agreed upon before commencement. No graphical skills are needed, we just need the business logic to drive it. An onsite coder is preferred, but the right person would be alright to work remotely. It&#8217;s anticipated that there will be a team of two developers, one of which is me :) If it all sounds good, send your resume to jobs at tangelix dot com.</blockquote>
