<p><a href="http://www.microplace.com">MicroPlace</a>, a site that lets you make small loans to workers in developing countries and receive a return, just recently launched.  Josh Susser, one of the contractors that worked on it, <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2007/10/24/microplace-launch">wrote a great introduction to the project</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As far as I am aware, MicroPlace is the first <span class="caps">SEC</span>-registered online brokerage implemented in Ruby on Rails. We had to go through an extensive security audit, and there were a lot of regulatory requirements for us to meet&#8230; But the bottom line is that we didn&#8217;t have any significant problems with either Ruby or Rails in passing those hurdles.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Josh also mentioned that MicroPlace is owned by eBay, making this the first Rails project at an otherwise all-Java shop.  Awesome, high-fives all around guys.  I hope to see more posts about the development aspect of the site.</p>
