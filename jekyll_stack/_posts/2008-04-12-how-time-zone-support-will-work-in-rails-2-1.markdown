<p>Geoff Buesing has writing a <a href="http://mad.ly/2008/04/09/rails-21-time-zone-support-an-overview/">great guide to the time zone support in Rails 2.1</a>. It goes through all the new features including how to setup per-user time zone support and more. Really good stuff. Geoff&#8217;s work will remove a lot of pain for a lot of people. Three cheers to his hard work.</p>
