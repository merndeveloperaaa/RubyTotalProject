<p><img src="http://www.sdmagazine.com/images/jolt_logo16_sm.gif" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px; border: 0"/><a href="http://www.sdmagazine.com/jolts/2005categories.html">The Jolt Awards</a> have been honoring products of excellence and high productivity for 15 years and this year both Rails 1.0 and <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> made the cut as finalists!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/01-20-2006/0004264613&amp;EDATE=">announcement</a> tells us that the book competes against such titles as Practical Common Lisp, Service-Oriented Architecture, and Wicked Cool Java. Rails 1.0 is going up against JBoss 4x, Coldfusion, and Zend Studio. Pretty exciting stuff. Hopefully we&#8217;ll be jolting in red shortly.</p>
