<p>Stefan Kaes&#8217; <a href="http://railsbench.rubyforge.org/">RailsBench benchmarking suite</a> is now <a href="http://railsexpress.de/blog/articles/2006/12/26/railsbench-gem-version-available">available as a gem</a>. This makes it even easier to get started benchmarking your application and find bottlenecks. Yay for ease of installation.</p>
