<p><a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com.au/index.html">ThoughtWorks</a> is <a href="http://jchyip.blogspot.com/2005/09/thoughtworks-hiring-in-australia.html">hiring people with design and development skills in Ruby on Rails</a> in three cities down under: Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney.</p>
<p>I met with their <span class="caps">CEO</span> and a select team in Chicago a few months back. They&#8217;re serious about giving Ruby on Rails a shot to push J2EE and .<span class="caps">NET</span> out of their oligarchical strangle hold on the enterprise. It&#8217;s exciting to see them move on that objective.</p>
