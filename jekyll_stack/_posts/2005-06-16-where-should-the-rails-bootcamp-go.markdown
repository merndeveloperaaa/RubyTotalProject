<p>Dave Thomas and Mike Clark are gearing up to run a series of Rails Bootcamps in the Fall. The idea is to take someone who haven&#8217;t been doing any Rails at all to become a capable driver of it. We&#8217;re talking a two-day fair with potentially another day assigned for a Ruby introduction. But where should it start? The two gents wants your opinion on that, so go <a href="http://wiki.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi/RailsTrainingVenue">vote for the Rails Bootcamp venue</a>.</p>
