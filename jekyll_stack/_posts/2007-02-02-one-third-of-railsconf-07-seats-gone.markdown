<p>So we had a suspicion that the seats for RailsConf &#8216;07 would sell fast, but this is ridiculously. A few hours after we&#8217;ve opened for registrations that <strike>close to</strike> more than a third of the seats for the conference would be gone. At this rate we might well sell out the conference even faster than last year.</p>
